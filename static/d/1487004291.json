It’s not often talked about as most people never end up changing the strings they use for their racquets because they take their stringers recommendation, which is definitely not a bad thing. I, however, wanted to learn more about the types of strings and which ones were best for me.","categories":["Common Questions"],"featured":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5086206896551724,"src":"/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/ac0ae/featured.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/dcd85/featured.jpg 175w,\n/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/be085/featured.jpg 350w,\n/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/ac0ae/featured.jpg 700w,\n/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/ddaee/featured.jpg 1050w,\n/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/cb76e/featured.jpg 1400w,\n/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/83b5a/featured.jpg 2838w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/how-to-hold-a-badminton-racquet/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"July 16, 2018","title":"How to Hold a Badminton Racquet - The Correct Badminton Grip","description":"I’ve been playing for a long time but every now and then I practice something and when it’s not working consistently I come back to the basics and see if there is anything I’m doing wrong there that might be hindering me practicing or playing a certain shot. One of the basics which is often overlooked is how you hold the racquet or your “grip”. I had a habit of letting the handle of the racquet turn too much in my grip, I was holding it too loose, and as a result, I wasn’t getting power or accuracy in some shots because when I hit the shuttle it was never with a consistent grip.","categories":["Common Questions","Beginners Info"],"featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/five-reasons-badminton-will-help-you-lose-weight/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"July 10, 2018","title":"5 Reasons Badminton Will Help You Lose Weight","description":"Everybody wants to be trim, everybody wants to stay in shape but not everybody enjoys going to the gym, I believe the best answer is finding a sport you love is the best way to get in shape as you’ll enjoy getting a sweat on more and it won’t feel like such a chore.","categories":["Common Questions"],"featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/which-badminton-racquet-is-best-for-me/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"July 07, 2018","title":"Which Badminton Racquet is Best for Me?","description":"I’ve played with the same badminton racquets for over 12 years, it wasn’t until I broke one of only two racquets I had (a Yonex Armortec 900 Power) that I realised I might need to get some more but after 12 years with the same racquets how was I going to be able to pick a new one right for me?","categories":["Common Questions","Beginners Info"],"featured":null}}}]}}}

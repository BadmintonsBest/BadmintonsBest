Hi fellow Badminton fan, I’m Liam. I’m the owner and face of the brand BadmintonsBest! Welcome and thank you for visiting.

I've been playing Badminton for over 17 years. Second only to my family, Badminton is my biggest passion in life. If I'm not with family I'm either playing or watching Badminton with the mission to be the best I can be. This site is where I can share what I've learnt from playing, being coached and from watching... Badmintons Best.

I started off playing when I was 11 years old. My mother was the person who got me started with Badminton. She used to take me to our local recreation centre to play socially on a Wednesday night. The people there were so encouraging and supportive that I improved very quickly. My mother realised I was fast outgrowing the beginner standard and that’s where my father came in. I’ve always enjoyed improving and seeing myself grow. My father found my first coach and just like that I became immersed in the Badminton world.

## Our Mission Statement

## The purpose of this blog

I started this blog as a passion project. To write and detail all my experience and knowledge I have gained about the sport of Badminton. Through this website and brand, I help others improve in Badminton and bring new people into this amazing sport. I’ve been fortunate enough to meet so many amazing people because of this sport and I want to share it and spread it throughout the world!

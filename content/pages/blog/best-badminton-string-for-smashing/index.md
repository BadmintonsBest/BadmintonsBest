A lot of players, especially less experienced players, ask me this or similar questions. They want to improve their smash to feel like they can win more points. I understand the jump smash in Badminton is exciting. When you hit a jump smash just right it feels really good. Even better if you manage to win the point. Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation out there regarding strings and tension.

So which is the best Badminton string for smashing? **One of the best strings for smashing on the market right now is Yonex's Aerosonic strings. They're the thinnest string in the world and have incredible repulsion power. For a more powerful smash you want a thin string with high repulsion.**

Yonex Aerosonic is just one example of a Badminton string that is great for smash power. Picking the right string isn’t a simple one choice answer though. Let's have a look at other strings available and why they're all good choices for hard-hitting players.

## The best qualities in a string for smashers

The Badminton smash is the most exciting shot in the game. It requires racquet speed and good timing to get the most out of it. What attributes does a string need to give us the most amount of power?

**A thin gauge.** The gauge is the diameter measurement of the string. Basically how thick it is. A thinner string is better for generating more power because the force of hitting the shuttle is spread over a smaller surface area. The smaller surface area puts the strings under more force and they will stretch. This will provide more power when they bounce back.

**Soft feeling**. Contrary to popular belief, softer feeling strings will give you more power. They will stretch easier than harder feeling strings giving more repulsion. Hard feeling strings will give you better feedback on more delicate shots but they're less durable for smashing.

**High repulsion.** Repulsion in strings is measured by how quickly they return back to normal. Strings are elastic and they stretch when under pressure. You want strings that snap back quickly after you hit the shuttle.

## Other things to consider for selecting a string

It's not all about getting the most powerful smash you can though. There's no point choosing a string like Yonex Aerosonic or Yonex BG66 Force if you're a beginner and unable to hit the shuttle in the sweet spot consistently. You'll break your strings more regularly when really you need something durable and reliable.

Durability becomes an issue with thinner strings. They don't withstand as much wear and tear that thicker strings can. Playing with a thin string will get very expensive if you're breaking them often. Not to mention that you'll have to have a few spares in the bag for when one does break. You can get a better balance of power and durability with other strings such as Yonex's BG80 Power. I play with this and it has great repulsion but stands more wear and tear then the thinner strings I've used.

The softer feeling strings make softer shots feel less precise. You get a trampoline effect from softer strings which gives you easier power. But when playing a net shot for example it's harder to feel all the impact of the shuttle making it harder to get the shot just right. Hard strings give you more feedback when hitting. It's like wearing either very running shoes or running barefoot. When you run in shoes it's easier on your joints and it feels comfortable but running in bare feet you'll feel the ground and all the texture and get more sensory feedback than with shoes on.

Like we mentioned, Badminton is not just all about power. It's a game of precision and ability. Some players play-styles aren't suited for all out smashing and offensive play. Some players do better when playing more technical shots and using good tactics and strategy. Some strings have qualities that lend themselves to these players such as Yonex's Aerobite. This string has a rough texture that grips the shuttle more on impact which makes it easier to spin the shuttle more for slices and tumbles.

So rather than select a Badminton string based on power for one shot, consider how you play and you experience level before choosing. Also, don't be afraid to experiment with different strings types and brands etc to find what's best for you.

## What tension is best for smashing?

Another common myth in Badminton is that tighter strings give you more power when smashing. This just isn't the case. Slacker strings give you more power more easily then the tighter strings will. Slacker strings give a bigger trampoline effect when you hit the shuttle. The strings are able to stretch more and then snap back to their original position with more force.

It seems logical that tighter string would mean the shuttle would bounce back quicker right? This is quite reasonable to think and is totally correct. However, most players don't generate enough power in their swing to make the strings stretch as much as they can. If the strings are already very tight then you have to exert even more force to get them to stretch and rebound.

For the average player, the best tension would be 24-27 pounds of tension. This is a nice middle ground where the strings are tight enough to have a good feel but also slack enough to make generating power in smashes and other shots efficient. For more advanced players then tensions of 29-30+ pounds will provide some extra power if they have the playing strength to be able to harness it but it's not a massive difference. Tighter strings are more beneficial for accuracy and feeling the shot more.

## Some of the best strings I recommend

I played with Yonex BG65 To strings for a long time and was very happy with them. It wasn't until I was trying someone new to string my racquet that they recommended me to try another string. Seeing how I played and knowing roughly what my standard was they recommended I try the BG80 Power strings at a slightly higher tension then what I was playing with. It was a great recommendation and I've never gone back. I've tried others before and since then and have asked other players what they use. So here is my list of strings I'd recommend for getting more out of your smash.

* **Yonex BG80 Power.**
* **Yonex BG66 Force.**
* **Yonex Aerosonic.**
* **Ashaway ZyMax Fire 66.**

## Related questions

**What is the best Badminton racquet for smashing?** It's commonly noted that head heavy racquets are the best for smashing power. The extra momentum generated by the racquet head creates more power when coupled with good technique.

**How often should I restring my Badminton racquet?** It's best to restring whenever the strings start to fray or when there is a noticeable drop in tension. Frayed strings will break sooner or later and a loss of tension will affect your shot precision.

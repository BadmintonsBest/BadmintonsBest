        Hi{" "}

        I'm Liam. I've been playing Badminton for over 15 years and along with
        my family is my biggest passion in life. If I'm not with family I'm
        either playing or watching Badminton on a mission to be the best I can
        be. This site is where I can share what I've learnt from playing, being
        coached and from watching... Badmintons Best.

Without equipment, you can‚Äôt play, unfortunately. Badminton equipment is widely available and affordable. There are very good basics sets on Amazon for people just getting started and there are online retailers that provide more professional equipment for players who want to get serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are the essential pieces of equipment for Badminton? &lt;strong&gt;You only need five pieces of equipment to get started with Badminton. These are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Badminton net and two posts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At least two Badminton racquets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some shuttlecocks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Badminton shoes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The right sports clothing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you don‚Äôt need much to get started then. For a lot of people, you‚Äôll be able to borrow most of these items from a local sports centre. Some people would say that you only need the first three items of this list, I‚Äôd disagree. The last items on the list are key to playing safely. Read on to find out why and how safety comes into a sport like Badminton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Badminton net and two posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Badminton net is a mesh net that‚Äôs 20ft long and 2.5ft tall. Topped with a white PVC coated headband with a thick cord running in between. The Badminton net has changed very little since the conception of the game. Commonly made from nylon now they don‚Äôt need replacing often or ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stand the net you need two posts. You can buy stand-alone net posts that are weighted or you can buy more recreational sets where the posts connected to the net. These popup net sets aren‚Äôt built to BWF regulation standards which means they‚Äôre normally not the right width, length or height but are good for a bit of fun in the garden or on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs essential to say that you might not need to buy these. Visit your local sports centre and most have facilities for playing Badminton. Not only will they have the nets, posts and even some racquets and shuttles but they‚Äôll have space, court markings and good flooring in an indoor environment where Badminton is meant to be played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;At least two Badminton racquets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badminton racquets come in many varieties. It‚Äôs the piece of Badminton equipment people talk about the most. To get started you don‚Äôt need anything too fancy but I‚Äôd still recommend getting a known Badminton brand. The cheap plastic racquets that come with Badminton sets are never worth the price no matter how cheap they are. They‚Äôre not realistic for playing Badminton properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need at least two of them, one for each player as Badminton requires at least two people to play. Two players playing against each other alone is called &lt;strong&gt;singles&lt;/strong&gt;. You can also play with two people on each side all of the same gender (all men/boys or all ladies/girls) and this is called &lt;strong&gt;doubles&lt;/strong&gt;. And you can also play &lt;strong&gt;mixed doubles&lt;/strong&gt; where one man/boy plays with one lady/girl for a total of two men/boys and two ladies/girls. For this, you‚Äôll need four racquets so everyone has one each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some shuttlecocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you have somewhere to play and something to getting with, so what do we hit? In Badminton we use shuttlecocks. Shuttlecocks come in two forms, plastic and feather shuttlecocks. A lot of people use plastic shuttlecocks when they first start off. They usually come with basic Badminton racquet sets and are cheap and easy to find at any sports shop or online. I‚Äôd argue that, even for beginners, plastic shuttlecocks are a bad choice for just getting started, here‚Äôs why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre a beginner, someone who‚Äôs just getting started playing and wants to get better, you need to play with feather shuttlecocks. Plastic shuttlecocks are designed for casual players who just want to have a bit of fun, no harm in that. The problem is that once you‚Äôre past the beginner level and start going to play at clubs, almost all clubs around the world now play with feather shuttlecocks. It‚Äôs the way the game was originally made. Natural materials used to make the shuttlecocks which included goose or duck feathers for the ‚Äúbirdie‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a beginner you still need feather shuttlecocks. You don‚Äôt need to spend a lot of money but as I‚Äôve explained before in our &lt;a href=&quot;/BadmintonsBest/recommended-gear/best-shuttlecocks/&quot;&gt;recommended shuttlecocks page&lt;/a&gt; buying ultra cheap shuttlecocks is a false economy. For beginners thought this shouldn‚Äôt matter too much. If you‚Äôre very new then you‚Äôre more likely to break shuttlecock from mishitting it with the frame regardless of the quality. But when you can consistently hit the shuttlecock with the strings having decent shuttles will last longer as you won‚Äôt be hitting them hard enough to wear them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good Badminton shoes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people might assume that you can just use running shoes, tennis shoes or gym.shoes for Badminton but they‚Äôre wrong. Different sports have specialised shoes for a reason. The biggest reason is for safety. Even with the most casual sports, there can be accidents and people can get hurt because they‚Äôre not using the right equipment. We have an article here that covers the difference between Tennis and Badminton shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always recommend getting a good pair of Badminton shoes. They offer so many benefits whilst playing. They provide shock absorption to help protect the ankles and knees, they‚Äôre well cushioned so provide all-around comfort when running and jumping and many more benefits. Take a look at our &lt;a href=&quot;/BadmintonsBest/recommended-gear/best-badminton-shoes/&quot;&gt;recommended shoes page&lt;/a&gt; to find the perfect pair for you. There is a shoe for anyone on any budget &lt;a href=&quot;/BadmintonsBest/recommended-gear/best-badminton-shoes/&quot;&gt;on this list&lt;/a&gt; so please get yourself a good pair of shoes, it‚Äôs an investment in your safety playing Badminton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The right sports clothing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badminton is going to get you sweaty so it‚Äôs only proper to dress for it. In the beginning, any sports gear will do, as long as it‚Äôs loose and breathable. You have to stretch a lot in Badminton so wearing shorts that are too tight or are a non-stretchy material will not be comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôre probably going to sweat a lot as well so wearing anything cotton is just going to stick to you. You need breathable, moisture-wicking sports gear to draw the sweat away from your body. This will help keep you cool and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badminton brands create some beautiful and well crafted clothes for all ages and sizes. They‚Äôre designed to help with all the points we talked about. The attention to detail they give their clothing is really special. A simple example is that Badminton shirts are designed with a wider arm opening to accommodate the constant reaching we do. It stops the shirt feeling too restrictive and is a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a beginner, you don‚Äôt need to go crazy and spend a lot of money either. There are so many brands that offer great clothing for a good price. Brands like Yonex, Viktor, Li-ning and more all offer apparel for any budget. Online shops like Amazon, DirectBadminton, CentralSports, Shop Badminton Online and many more make it so easy to get some clothing to start off with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;These are the essentials, what next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are only five pieces of equipment you need to get started playing. Anything else you have after that is a bonus. But like any sport, there are things that are nice to have and become more essential to have the more you play. As you get better you‚Äôll find that you might need some of these items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Court mop/sweeper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are two pieces of equipment with two different purposes. Court mops are used to mop up any sweat or liquid off the court. Any liquid on a Badminton court is a serious hazard for players. You can use special court mops designed for Badminton or any highly absorbent mop. Badminton mops tend to be a lot bigger because of the size of the Badminton court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A court sweeper is meant for clearing debris off the courts surface. Anything like dust, feathers and dirt gets swept up with these scissor-like sweepers. They‚Äôre sometimes called V-sweepers because of the shape. These are also used for safety. Clearing the Badminton court of debris is essential for keeping a safe playing environment for everyone playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that these pieces of equipment are actually essentials for elite players. Any tournaments at national or international level have these to hand for use on all courts. International have regulated referees and officials and the linesmen officials are the ones responsible for doing the mopping and sweeping of the courts regularly to keep players safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Towels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you start to get better you‚Äôre going to be playing for longer, running farther and moving around a lot more. This naturally will get you sweating even more. Sweating so much that you‚Äôre going to need to dry off a bit. Even just to wipe yourself down a bit between games you‚Äôll need a couple of towels to hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drying yourself off will stop your clothes from getting too wet or letting sweat get into your shoes and socks. Again, you can get towels from Badminton brands or you can just use any highly absorbent towel is good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wristbands and headbands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don‚Äôt often see players use these anymore. Wristbands and headbands used to be popular. They‚Äôre practical, especially for players who do sweat quite a bit. Just being able to wipe your forehead or hands with something that will take away the sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players like Nathan Robertson made them part of their look and you can get some with logos and nice designs. You see players on the elite stage always needing to towel when it‚Äôs a long game so I‚Äôm surprised not more of them wear these. You can pick some up from any sports shop or online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Related questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the regulations for the equipment for Badminton?&lt;/strong&gt; There are regulations for racquets, nets, courts and shuttlecocks set by the BWF. The BWF detail the approval process for these &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.bwfbadminton.com/events/equipment-approval-scheme/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This page has the regulation details for all equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

They‚Äôre both racquet sports, they both require great speed and agility, to play well you need to have good hand-eye coordination and so on. Like many sports, they‚Äôre easy to start but difficult to master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is Tennis or Badminton harder? &lt;strong&gt;If you take the various areas of comparison for each sport we find that Badminton is a lot harder physically when it comes to speed, agility and explosive power. Badminton also has a lot more variations of strokes compared to Tennis so there is more to learn. The smaller court and faster projectile mean you need to have fast reactions as well as fast feet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs hard to say one is definitely harder than the other. They‚Äôre two separate sports with their own different dynamics. They both have unique aspects that make them harder in different ways. Let‚Äôs have a look at what we can compare in more depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fitness and physical demand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest comparison we can make between Tennis and Badminton is comparing the endurance and how physically demanding each sport is. It‚Äôs the easiest thing to compare between any sports. You need to be incredibly fit for both Tennis and Badminton when played at the top level. But even at lower levels of play, you need to have some endurance, speed and power for both. Let‚Äôs have a look at how each sport compares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Footwork and covering the court&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good footwork is one of the building blocks for any racquet sport like Tennis and Badminton. They both have different types of footwork though. Badminton has a mixture of short, sharp chasses and running and jumping. Tennis requires some chasse movement but predominantly requires a lot of running and sometimes sliding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Tennis court is roughly 1.5x larger than a Badminton court (see our article on comparing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.badmintonsbest.com/blog/badminton-vs-tennis-courts/&quot;&gt;Tennis and Badminton courts&lt;/a&gt;). Tennis players, especially singles players, play from the baseline and because the ball can bounce out of the court they need to cover not just the size of the court but beyond it. Tennis has you cover potentially longer distances after each shot during the rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Badminton, if the shuttlecock goes out, one player hits the net or is faulted or scores a point the rally is over. The shuttlecock can‚Äôt travel outside of the court so you know as a Badminton player the size of the court you need to cover. Badminton requires fast reactions and even faster movement to cover this albeit smaller court. Badminton has you cover long and short distances at high speed during a whole match. You need to have explosive power and agility to cover the whole court in Badminton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, you cover less court overall when you play doubles rather than singles in both Tennis and Badminton. The amount you cover depends on the length of the rally and the standard you play at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Length of games, matches, rallies and breaks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennis matches at the elite level can last anywhere from one hour to well over three hours. That‚Äôs a long time on the court. The longest tennis match in history lasted eleven hours and five minutes! Nicolas Mahut and John Isner battled it out at Wimbledon over three days before eventually, Isner won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is obviously a very rare case and because of how the rules are set then it could have gone on forever. Badminton matches on the other hand can last anywhere from &lt;strong&gt;30 minutes to just under two hours&lt;/strong&gt;. The length of Badminton matches varies greatly because of the different disciplines and the general style of play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badminton styles vary a great deal more in Badminton between singles, doubles and mixed then Tennis does. Men‚Äôs doubles matches are fast and furious and can be over in less than 30 minutes. Women‚Äôs doubles has a more consistent flow. The top pairs all have excellent defences which make the matches last longer. So the amount of time on the court can depend on which discipline you play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The longest Badminton match was two hours and 41 minutes long.&lt;/strong&gt; Naoko Fukuman and Kurumi Yonao from Japan battled with Nitya Krishinda Maheswari and Greysia Polii of Indonesia in the Badminton Asia Championships. The Japanese pair came out on top in a brilliant display of endurance and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennis matches definitely last longer than your standard Badminton match, even at the top level. There was a study &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-much-tennis-is-played-during-a-match-1378248020?tesla=y#articleTabs%3Darticle&quot;&gt;by The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; that looked at various Tennis matches and measured the active play time against the overall match length. They found that &lt;strong&gt;Tennis matches have on average a 17.5% active play time&lt;/strong&gt;. The rest of the time is players going from point to point, towelling down, breaks and changing ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at a Badminton match in comparison there isn‚Äôt a lot of wasted time. They do have time between each point but umpires are policing the ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;continuous play rule‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; more strictly than ever before. This rule states that play must be continuous with little time wasted between points. They also have only two minutes between each game and just 30 seconds when the first player gets to 11 points. I studied various matches and found that Badminton has much higher active play time. It‚Äôs between 40-50% on average which means an hour-long match could have as much as 30 minutes of the shuttlecock being in play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs worth mentioning briefly the rally lengths of each sport. On average Tennis rallies last longer than in Badminton. Because the player has a larger court, slower projectile and the ball can bounce rallies tend to last longer. Badminton rallies can be long though, especially in doubles with equally matches pairs with strong defences. In Badminton, a 30-second rally would yield about double the amount shots then a 30-second rally in Tennis. So Badminton has a much higher intensity. Players have very little time between shots. Watch the video below, it shows the longest rally in Badminton history. The rally lasts more than &lt;strong&gt;4 minutes and 30 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;! They play a total of 255 shots. That definitely takes some endurance.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;h2&gt;The technique, mastering the shots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennis and Badminton are both racquet sports so naturally one of their hardest traits is mastering all the shots. Both sports have evolved over the years and thanks to new technology with racquets, balls and shuttlecocks new ways of playing have emerged. Let‚Äôs look at some strokes from each sport and difficult some of them can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tennis shots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handling a powerful shot coming at you requires strong wrists. Tennis racquets and Tennis balls are much heavier than a shuttlecock and Badminton racquet. So just controlling the weighted force behind certain shots is difficult in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling spin is a challenge in Tennis. Playing the ball requires observing the spin of the ball and being able to counter or control the spin. This is a difficult skill. Playing the ball with different slices and spins creates a lot of variation. The weight of the ball means you need a good technique to handle the return properly. Here is a list of some Tennis shots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Topspin shots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slice shots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overhead serve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lob shot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop shot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Badminton shots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badminton has a wide variety of shots and you can play them from different positions. Unlike Tennis, you play Badminton shots from different heights. From playing an overhead smash to defending a smash down by your feet. Badminton has you twist and turn, jump and lunge and still play shots whilst doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badminton requires both power and finesse. It‚Äôs explosive and the variety of shots show that you need aggression and control. Here is a list of some Badminton shots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forehand serve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backhand serve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop shots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netshot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive shots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the shots in Badminton. It‚Äôs worth bearing in mind that there can be variations of each shot. The Badminton smash is a good example where there is the power smash, the stick smash, the half smash and sliced smashes etc. This is where deception then plays a big role in Badminton. It‚Äôs very difficult to master but if you can make one shot look just like another you can keep your opponents on the backfoot. You can deceive them, send them the wrong way and disrupt their footwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs impossible to master all the shots in Badminton as there are just too many. Top players can execute all of them but I doubt any one player has mastered them all. We can always improve and everyone finds certain shots easier to pick up than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tactics and mental strength&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sports require a lot of physical ability and talent, but this is just one layer. Tactical awareness and planning and mental fortitude are needed to succeed in sports. Tennis and Badminton players use these skills in various ways. Let‚Äôs look at how these compare in both Tennis and Badminton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rally scoring and serving&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So both Tennis and Badminton use rally point scoring which means each player can score even when they‚Äôre not serving. This creates a different dynamic when developing tactics and how the sport is played. For Badminton, this means keeping the initiative and being on the attack is so important. Playing defensively has little advantage when you can score when you‚Äôre serving or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Badminton, it‚Äôs clear to see when a player is on the offence or the defence. This is because of the height of the net and the easiest way to score a point is to land the shuttlecock on your opponents‚Äô side of the court. If you‚Äôre on the defence it‚Äôs obvious as the opponent is trying to hit the shuttlecock down into the ground. When you‚Äôre attacking you‚Äôre trying to do the same. In Tennis, this dynamic does not exist. Most of the time the players are on level footing and looking to create openings by out-manoeuvring their opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serving is, again, crucial to both sports but for different reasons. In Badminton, the service is different for doubles and singles. In doubles, the objective is to protect yourself by serving well enough so that your opponent can‚Äôt attack or win the point straight away. Because most people‚Äôs tactic is to serve short and tight over the net you need to be able to serve well even under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In singles, there is less pressure from the opponent when serving because there is more court area to serve to. You‚Äôre able to serve long or short and you‚Äôre opponent can‚Äôt really gamble on one or the other because they have no partner help them after they return the serve. In Badminton, it can almost feel like a disadvantage when serving because of this. You need to be mentally strong when serving and hold your nerve when playing against aggresive opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big difference between Tennis is that your service is your biggest advantage. In Badminton, you alternate serving when you or the opponent scores a point. If you don‚Äôt score you don‚Äôt get to serve. In Tennis one player serves for one game and then they switch after that game. Serving in Tennis is such a massive advantage because there are so many ways you can set up the rally and there are a lot fewer restrictions when serving in Tennis compared to Badminton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Tennis, you serve with an overhead smash effectively. There are so many variations you can do whilst serving though such as slicing it, playing it straight, playing it super fast or slower etc. It‚Äôs so advantageous that they the ‚Äúace‚Äù which is when one player serves and the other isn‚Äôt even able to get it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The cost of mistakes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single Badminton match is the best of three games, each game is played to 21 points. A single match of Tennis is usually the best of three or five sets, each set is the first to six games. In Tennis, there are more opportunities to come back if you‚Äôre losing in a match. This is because there are a lot of games in Tennis. If you‚Äôre losing a set 3-0, the opponent needs to win another four points to get another game but you also only need to win four points to get a game back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of mistakes in Badminton is less forgiving. Because there are only three games if you find yourself 10-0 down in the first game it‚Äôs a long way back to try and win the game. You need to score twice as many points as your opponent to win that game. Often matches can be decided early on when one player gets a good string of points. This makes Badminton a very difficult sport for players who are inconsistent. In Tennis, you can afford some mistakes here and there but still be able to come back in a set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Matches and the nature of each sport&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennis and Badminton have so many unique aspects and attributes. Many of these determine the nature of how people play the game. The sports have been around so long that people have found optimal ways of playing shots, footwork and tactics that just work well for each sport. Let‚Äôs have a look at how the nature of each sport makes them difficult to master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tennis, a test of endurance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennis requires stamina and endurance. Despite the relatively low active playtime players are on the court for a long time. Matches are draining, long rallies covering large distances on the court requires good aerobic capacity. We‚Äôve already mentioned the long match times elite players can experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just being on the court for a couple of hours without a lot of play time is still a long time in general. The key with Tennis is being able to ‚Äúbreak‚Äù your opponents serve. In Tennis, it‚Äôs more advantageous to be serving as it gives you a chance to set up the rally. If you can‚Äôt break your opponent‚Äôs service game then matches can really start to drag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern game has faster serves and faster shots in general. This means being able to cover long distances quickly is a must. Like a sprinter, you need to be quick out of the blocks to cover the shot. Agility is useful but not key as players have more time to see and react to shots coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Badminton, a test of speed, power and calculation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badminton is the fastest racquet sport in the world. At the top level players hit smashes at well over 350kmph! The fastest Badminton smash ever recorded was 493kmph in test conditions, 426kmph in competition level. The video below shows Mads Pieler Kolding hitting the famous 426kpmh smash.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;p&gt;Badminton is all about speed and power but equally about tactical awareness and precision. Beginners find Badminton easy to pick up and get going. As they get better they learn to increase the speed at which they play. The tempo of Badminton can change from rally to rally but the most successful players play at a high pace. They take the initiative and play aggressively to actively win points. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to win Badminton playing defensively. Players train to be faster on their feet, quicker with their racquet and plan three steps ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players need a lot of anaerobic capacity to play Badminton effectively. Rallies are bursting with power and energy. You need the stamina to be able to perform at 100% of your work rate to win. The activity level is similar to HIIT training. You have short-long bursts of high intensity and then you have a short rest. Players need a good combination of speed, power and stamina, that‚Äôs a tough balance to get right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badminton is also a game of fine margins. It‚Äôs the difference between the shuttlecock landing in or out or the shuttlecock hitting the net and rolling over or rolling back. Badminton requires a lot of precision and accuracy. Players need to be able to put their opponents under pressure by pushing them around the court to outmanoeuvre them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping it up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing Tennis and Badminton is like comparing apples and pears. They have similarities as racquet sports and they‚Äôre challenging sports in their own rights. Everything measured up I still believe that Badminton is the more difficult sport. It‚Äôs both physically demanding and technically demanding. It‚Äôs a game of fine margins and expert tactics with so many different play styles it‚Äôs impossible to master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Related questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is playing Badminton easy?&lt;/strong&gt; Badminton played at the highest level is not an easy sport. Badminton played leisurely with friends and fun absolutely is. It‚Äôs easy for people to get started with Badminton. The lightness of the shuttlecock and racquet compared to other sports make it easy for beginners to get started hitting the bird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Badminton good exercise?&lt;/strong&gt; Badminton is excellent exercise at any level. If you‚Äôre a beginner or a more advanced player it‚Äôs a sport that gets you moving. Humans are adapted to constant movement, we‚Äôre not made for sitting still. Badminton gets you moving in most ways you can imagine so it‚Äôs very well rounded exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

Playing Badminton requires having a pair of shoes, racquets, spare clothes and socks, shuttlecocks and other bits and bobs. That‚Äôs a lot of stuff to carry around. Fortunately, if you get a good bag you‚Äôll be able to carry all of that around without any trouble. My Badminton bag is my pride and joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, some Badminton bags are not cheap. Not everyone can spend a lot of money just for a bag. &lt;strong&gt;So here are the four Badminton bags I‚Äôd recommend to suit any budget and any player.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Head Elite Backpack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonex Team 4926 6 Racket Bag (Red)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonex 9831WEX Pro Tournament Racket Bag (Black)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonex 98212 Pro 12 Racket Bag (Infinite Blue)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list goes from lowest to highest price. They‚Äôre all good bags but some will be more suitable to you than others. Read on to find the best Badminton bag for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Head Elite Backpack - The Best Budget Bag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bag is perfect for anyone on a budget or players just starting out. If you don‚Äôt have a lot of equipment this bag is perfect for you. It can hold two racquets, has a dedicated pocket for shoes, a side pocket for accessories etc and a large main compartment for clothes, drinks and other larger items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs the smallest bag on this list and the cheapest. It‚Äôs the size of the average backpack so everyone can manage with it but big enough to store a decent amount of kit. It‚Äôs at a great price on Direct Badminton for ¬£23.99. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.directbadminton.co.uk/deptproduct/badminton/bags-rackets/head-elite-backpack-(red-black)?ProductID=33601&quot;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yonex Team 4926 6 Racket Bag (Red) - The Best Middleground Bag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next bag on this list is more the traditional design of a racquet bag. It holds up to six Badminton racquets, has a small side compartment for accessories, a large compartment for clothes, shoes and shuttlecocks. The only thing this bag lacks is a dedicated shoe compartment but if you get this shoe bag (/recommended-gear/best-badminton-accessories/#sports-shoe-bag) from our Best Badminton Accessories (/recommended-gear/best-badminton-accessories/) list then it‚Äôs not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a single handle and a shoulder strap handle, it‚Äôs easy to carry. A more spacious bag for those who need to carry a bit more with them. More suited to regular players with more racquets and equipment. It‚Äôs a great price for a bag with plenty of space to holds racquets and everything else. Find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.directbadminton.co.uk/deptproduct/badminton/bags-rackets/yonex-team-4926-6-racket-bag-(red)?ProductID=34376&quot;&gt;here on Direct Badminton&lt;/a&gt; for ¬£31.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yonex 9831WEX Pro Tournament Racket Bag (Black) - The Best High-End Bag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre serious about Badminton and have a sense of style then the Yonex 9831WEX Pro bag is the one for you. This bag holds up to six racquets, has a side compartment for all your accessories, has two main compartments and a shoe compartment. This bag has enough space for everything you need. More in the shape of a traditional duffel bag and less like a racquet bag it looks beautiful coupled with the geometric black and grey design. I see more and more players going for this style of bag over the traditional racquet bag shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the higher end bags you can get and for a true enthusiast, it‚Äôs worth it. With so much space available you‚Äôll never find yourself having to leave anything at home. Going for ¬£54.99 on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.directbadminton.co.uk/deptproduct/badminton/bags-rackets/yonex-9831wex-pro-tournament-racket-bag-(black)?ProductID=34347&quot;&gt;Direct Badminton&lt;/a&gt; it‚Äôs a quality bag for the serious player that will last a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yonex 98212 Pro 12 Racket Bag (Infinite Blue) - The Best Luxury Bag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest bag on this list by far, it‚Äôs best for the seriously committed athlete. Sporting two racquets compartments holding six racquets each for a total of twelve racquets, one huge main compartment, multiple side zipped pockets and a dedicated shoe compartment. This bag could be used for two-three people! So much space and plenty of luxury details such as thermally insulated compartments for racquets and double padded shoulder straps, this bag has it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd recommend this bag for only those who have more kit then they can count. Coaches can benefit too with so much space to store shuttles and spare racquets you‚Äôll never be without. By far the most expensive bag on the list, going for ¬£94.80 on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.directbadminton.co.uk/deptproduct/badminton/bags-rackets/yonex-98212-pro-12-racket-bag-(infinite-blue)?ProductID=31421&quot;&gt;Direct Badminton&lt;/a&gt; it‚Äôs a considerable investment but considering mine has lasted well over four years it‚Äôs a good investment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Best and Only Shuttlecocks You‚Äôll Ever Need]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article might ruffle a few feathers (pun intended) in the Badminton community, but I only recommend one kind of shuttlecock.

I‚Äôve played with a lot of different shuttlecock brands over the years and have found only a few that are worth what you pay for them, cheap or expensive. Unless you play only for leisure and have no interest in competitive play I wouldn‚Äôt even recommend plastic nylon shuttlecocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why is that feather shuttlecocks have become a bit of a false economy. Some people buy the cheapest feather shuttlecocks they can get because that‚Äôs all they can afford. I guarantee that they‚Äôll go through more of those cheaper shuttles and end up paying just as much as they would have for better quality shuttlecocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My recommendation for the best shuttlecocks that balance cost, quality of flight and durability are Yonex‚Äôs Aerosensa 30 and 40 shuttlecocks. They‚Äôre incredibly good quality in terms of a consistent flight and hitting. Yonex makes shuttlecocks as nobody else can. The durability of the Aerosensa 30s and 40s sets them apart. Treated right, one shuttle can last a couple of games.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs have a closer look at what makes Yonex‚Äôs Aeronsensa 30s and 40s shuttlecocks so great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hitting the bird, a quality cork base&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a house, to build a quality shuttlecock you need a solid foundation. The base of the shuttlecock is the foundation. Yonex only uses 100% solid cork. Some other brands use composite cork or a combination of solid and composite cork, this leads to a lack of quality and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often see cheaper shuttles use composite cork for the base. What happens when the shuttle is used for a while is that the cork starts to concave. The shuttle base is made with cheap filler that can‚Äôt withstand the shock and power of being hit constantly. You get a drastically different feel when you hit the shuttle. It can make you shots feel less crisp and leads to inconsistent feedback from the shuttle. It‚Äôs hard to get a good feel for your shots as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yonex uses only 100% quality cork which makes them super durable. You get good consistent feedback from the shuttle even after using the same shuttle for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The flight, goose feathers trimmed to perfection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every shuttlecock has 16 feathers in it. The best shuttlecocks are made with goose feathers. Yonex go a step further and only select the longest feathers from only the left wing of a goose. There‚Äôs a good reason for this. The longer feathers are stronger than the shorter ones providing better durability. They also only choose them from the left wing so that all the feathers used have the same aerodynamic properties. This allows for a realisable, consistent flight path for the shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheaper shuttlecocks will either use duck feathers or goose feathers but not of the same wing or feather length. This leads to poor durability and inconsistent flight, not just for one shuttle, but between one and the rest. Quality feathers are so important that without them it‚Äôs impossible to make a good shuttlecock. Yonex never fails to deliver in this front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The finest components, attention to detail, true craftsmanship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yonex doesn‚Äôt skimp on quality for anything. They take amazing attention to detail when creating Badminton equipment. Have a watch of this video below which shows how Yonex shuttlecocks are made. The attention to detail and level of craftsmanship is unparalleled.&lt;/p&gt;

          &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;p&gt;Quality runs throughout every inch of a Yonex shuttlecock. They continually improve and innovate products. Aside from the feathers and cork they also have a special formula for the glue they use for shuttlecocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see from the video that Yonex employs highly precise machinery. They‚Äôre used to wash, cut and shape the feathers. They‚Äôre used to cut the cork and leather cover. They‚Äôre used to insert the feather and tie them together with string. This is important, these machines are so incredibly precise it provides consistency in the production line. Consistency which means a consistent experience for us Badminton players to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machines are great for speed, efficiency and precision but true craftsmanship requires a human touch. At every stage of the process of making Yonex shuttlecocks, there is quality control. You see people checking the shuttlecocks for shape, speed and packing. Making small adjustments or grouping shuttles into similar speeds. Yonex still has the human touch everyone wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where to buy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of places to buy Yonex shuttlecocks. Any Badminton retailer will stock them. You can find them at bigger sports stores in the UK and America but the easiest way to buy them is off Amazon. The Aerosensa 30s can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/YONEX-AeroSensa-30-Feather-Badminton-Shuttlecocks/dp/B000ZLTFPK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=U845Y2U5TPBN&amp;#x26;keywords=yonex+aerosensa+30&amp;#x26;qid=1559142024&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sprefix=yonex+aero%2Caps%2C230&amp;#x26;sr=8-1https://www.amazon.co.uk/YONEX-AeroSensa-30-Feather-Badminton-Shuttlecocks/dp/B000ZLTFPK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=U845Y2U5TPBN&amp;#x26;keywords=yonex+aerosensa+30&amp;#x26;qid=1559142024&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sprefix=yonex+aero%2Caps%2C230&amp;#x26;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;here on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; as well as the Aerosensa 40s on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yonex-Aerosensa-40-Shuttlecocks-White/dp/B003V8TAS6/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=yonex+aerosensa+40&amp;#x26;qid=1559142033&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Amazon here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The 11 Best Badminton Accessories Everyone Should Have]]></title><description><![CDATA[You don‚Äôt need a lot of equipment when playing Badminton regularly, but there are a few items that are always good to have on hand when‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://www.badmintonsbest.com/recommended-gear/best-badminton-accessories/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.badmintonsbest.com/recommended-gear/best-badminton-accessories/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;You don‚Äôt need a lot of equipment when playing Badminton regularly, but there are a few items that are always good to have on hand when needed. I find that a lot of players don‚Äôt carry even a couple of these items off the list. They‚Äôre practical and when anybody needs some I can always share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are 11 accessories and gadgets I recommend anyone who plays Badminton to have in their bag.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pair of scissors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black electrical tape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonex Super Grap Overgrips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White easy tear zinc oxide tape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sports Kinesiology tape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Heat and Deep Freeze&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sports shoe bag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Badminton shoe insole&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonex Badminton socks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Odour eater inserts and spray&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A skipping rope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on to find out why these items are useful to have stashed in your Badminton bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A pair of scissors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs an easy and cheap recommendation to make for any Badminton player. Whether you need to cut some tape, trim racquet grips or cut out the remains of broken racquet strings they‚Äôre handy in many situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don‚Äôt need anything too heavy duty but I‚Äôve found it worth spending a little more for a pair that won‚Äôt break when trying to cut something a little tougher. People often break the strings of their racquet when playing and it‚Äôs good to cut the rest of the strings up once one has gone so that the tension from the racquet is released. Leaving one string broken whilst the others remain can distort the racquet head because the tension is no longer evenly spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other times people just need to cut some tape or are redoing the grip on their racquet and need to trim it to the right length. It‚Äôs always good to have a pair handy not just yourself but so you can lend them to others. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/AmazonBasics-Titanium-Blade-Soft-Grip-Scissors-1-Pack/dp/B01BRGUC9Y/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=scissors&amp;#x26;qid=1558555378&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sr=8-5&quot;&gt;This pair&lt;/a&gt; I found on Amazon from Amazon Basics do the job great at a good price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Black electrical tape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is an odd one. I don‚Äôt particularly like the magnetic sticky tape that you get with racquets grip wraps when you buy them. They‚Äôre not terrible but they always end up peeling away in the end. I instead have a couple of these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Insulation-Tape-Electrical-19mm-Black/dp/B004CSC4W8/ref=sr_1_3?crid=8T58ZJ9N9VLP&amp;#x26;keywords=black+electrical+tape&amp;#x26;qid=1558555736&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sprefix=black+ele%2Caps%2C145&amp;#x26;sr=8-3&quot;&gt;black electric tapes&lt;/a&gt; from Amazon in my bag to finish off the top of the grip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tradesmen use it for all sorts but mainly used by electricians. It‚Äôs got a strong stickiness that lasts, you won‚Äôt find yourself resticking it all the time or have it peeling off. It also smooths out very nicely so it doesn‚Äôt create any additional bulk where you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond using it for grips I use it for marking tubes in my bag which have used shuttles. Just sticking it around the tube shows me straight away if the tube has new or old shuttles in it. Just a couple of examples but worth the buy as it‚Äôs quite cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yonex Super Grap Overgrips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of players in Badminton, people who play with towel grips and those who don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve tried both in the past and I‚Äôve never really seen the benefits of towel grips. I always stick to using Yonex‚Äôs Super Grap Overgrips for all my racquets. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yonex-Super-Grap-Overgrip-Black/dp/B001FRJKEO/ref=sr_1_1?crid=HVY61LGNVT8R&amp;#x26;keywords=yonex+super+grap+overgrip&amp;#x26;qid=1558555910&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sprefix=yonex+super%2Caps%2C135&amp;#x26;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;buy them on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of colours to suit your style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to use the PU grips and replace my whole grip every time but I kept finding that I‚Äôd do it slightly differently or get it slightly wrong and it takes a little getting used to again once you start playing with it. These Overgrips are so thin that they add very little to your grip size and means you only need to replace this top layer to get a fresh grip again. We have an article on PU and Overgrips that you can read here. It details what these two different grips are and the differences between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs always handy to have a few of these knocking around in your bag for when you need a fresh grip, especially if you play a lot. A must buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;White easy tear zinc oxide tape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc oxide tape is a common physio sports tape that is used to immobilise joints. Used a lot in Rugby this tape is commonly used to protect ankles and knees from injury and also as a support for the joints to prevent injury. This is its main purpose but I actually use it for something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tape is decent for strapping but I‚Äôve found that it fails to stick once you start sweating. I use this for taping up my wedding and other rings I wear. I find that when I do start to sweat my rings are prone to slip off. I put some of this tape around the rings and my finger to just hold them on. It works really well. This tape is also brilliant for any simple taping need for keeping on plasters or first aid treatment, providing a protective layer to the wood on the handle of my racquet before I apply grips and creating make-shift labels (they‚Äôre easy to write on with a pen). You can buy them off &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zinc-Oxide-Tearable-Sports-2-5cm/dp/B00BEVYCEY/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2LC3XEJGOTBI4&amp;#x26;keywords=white+zinc+oxide+tape&amp;#x26;qid=1558556046&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sprefix=white+zinc+oxid%2Caps%2C203&amp;#x26;sr=8-4&quot;&gt;Amazon here&lt;/a&gt; and get three at a bargain price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sports Kinesiology tape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like the zinc oxide tape, Sports Kinesiology tape is used by athletes and physiotherapists as a support bandage. They‚Äôre applied in a particular direction to support muscles, tendons and joints. They‚Äôre a lot better sticking on even when you start to sweat than zinc oxide tape is. You see this used by a lot of the top athletes nowadays. They wear it for preventative measures and to aid with existing minor injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can buy this at a great price on Amazon and this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Physix-Gear-Sport-Kinesiology-Guide/dp/B017TH9YUI/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=I484LMQSH1GY&amp;#x26;keywords=kinesiology+tape&amp;#x26;qid=1558556154&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sprefix=kine%2Caps%2C144&amp;#x26;sr=8-2-spons&amp;#x26;psc=1&quot;&gt;top brand&lt;/a&gt; also packages their tape with a special guide that details how to apply it for different areas of the body. Over 2000 reviews it‚Äôs a tried and tested product. For anyone who picks up minor injuries frequently or plays a lot and could benefit from the support every now and then, it‚Äôs a no brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep Heat and Deep Freeze&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are two great products that I always carry but hope to never use. Deep Heat is a pain relief warming spray. You spray it directly onto the skin. It‚Äôs used to help sore or tightened muscles relax by dilating the blood vessels and promoting increased blood flow. It‚Äôs a form of heat therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Freeze is the cold therapy version of Deep Heat. It‚Äôs also a pain relief spray but cools the skin and beneath where you apply it. It‚Äôs used to reduce pain and swelling in muscles and joints. It reduces blood flow circulation to relieve inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these sprays can come in handy for Badminton. Deep Heat is good to have if you suffer from chronic injuries and need to relax the muscles. Deep Freeze is good for if you pick up an injury during a match and need some instant pain relief and reduce potential damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve had to use both of these and they work so well. I don‚Äôt advise depending on them for day-to-day practice, training or matches but they‚Äôre good to have in an emergency. It‚Äôs also good to be able to offer help to teammates or other players when the occasion arises. Both products can be found on Amazon (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Heat-Spray-150ml/dp/B003CHI4TC/ref=lp_1761931031_1_4_a_it?srs=1761931031&amp;#x26;ie=UTF8&amp;#x26;qid=1558556255&amp;#x26;sr=8-4&quot;&gt;Deep Heat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Freeze-Cold-Spray-150ml/dp/B00ULJX79G/ref=lp_1669404031_1_2_a_it?srs=1669404031&amp;#x26;ie=UTF8&amp;#x26;qid=1558556363&amp;#x26;sr=8-2&quot;&gt;Deep Freeze&lt;/a&gt;) and you can buy them in packs to save more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sports shoe bag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not an accessory that people think to have but I‚Äôll tell you why you need it. I‚Äôve always had the big tournament series type of Badminton bags. They hold a lot of racquets and have side pockets etc. One of the more useful features is that they tend to have a separate compartment to put your shoes in. Saves the rest of the bag from getting dirtied and dusty from your court shoes. The only problem with putting them straight in there is that the dirt and dust will just build up in there. Once you‚Äôve had the bag a while it‚Äôll you‚Äôll need to start cleaning it to avoid getting mould from the humidity of your shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great way to solve this problem is to put your shoes in a little shoe bag. They‚Äôre made from breathable nylon and are much easier to wash with not being connected to the rest of your bag. It also means you can store your shoes in any other part of your bag especially if your Badminton bag doesn‚Äôt have a shoe pocket. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/TRAVELTO-Shoe-Bag-storage-carrying/dp/B01LW463CQ/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=sports+shoe+bag&amp;#x26;qid=1558556393&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sr=8-5&quot;&gt;These bags on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; fit any shoe size and you get two of them, perfect for keeping a spare pair of shoes in your bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Badminton shoe insole&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it‚Äôs to replace your current insoles, to provide more support on top of your existing ones or to provide better grip between your sock and insole at some point you‚Äôll need a pair of insoles. Most people play with the same pair of shoes until they give out, never thinking about wear and tear on the inside of the shoe too. A good pair of Badminton shoes can last a long time but I can guarantee the insoles don‚Äôt last as long. They‚Äôll start to get holes in them and any texture they had will eventually be smoothed out giving you less stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a good idea to check your insoles regularly to see if they need replacing. I needed a pair to stop my sock slipping inside my shoe and provide better arch support for my foot. This pair from Victor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.directbadminton.co.uk/sport/badminton/accessories-rackets/victor/victor-vt-xd-8-insole?ProductID=27237&quot;&gt;on Direct Badminton&lt;/a&gt; provides great arch support, grip between the sock and sole and adds more comfort and support when jumping and moving about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yonex Badminton socks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just Yonex but any Badminton brand socks really. Most people don‚Äôt know that there is a big difference between socks designed for Badminton and regular or even sports socks. Badminton socks are thicker, more durable and have a higher thread count compared to other socks. They‚Äôre designed to lick moisture away from your feet and let it escape. They‚Äôre also not as stretchy as normal socks which provides more protection against blisters and rubbing. Some brands add texture to the bottom of the socks to provide better grip between shoe and sock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can buy a three pack of Yonex‚Äôs best socks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/YONEX-SOCKS-19131-White-Black/dp/B07BBV6KF2/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1EO6BTSRHQB0Q&amp;#x26;keywords=yonex+badminton+socks&amp;#x26;qid=1558558599&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sprefix=yonex+ba%2Caps%2C175&amp;#x26;sr=8-3&quot;&gt;here on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. They‚Äôre a bit pricey for socks but they‚Äôre so comfortable. You‚Äôll notice the difference straight away and wonder how you managed without them before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Odour eater inserts and spray&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve recommended a lot of accessories that are footwear related and for good reason. Footwork is paramount in Badminton, you‚Äôll be moving a lot. It‚Äôs worth investing in looking after your feet and footwear. The final pieces of essential equipment for footwear are odour eater inserts and odour eater spray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These inserts from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/DEODORISER-Activated-Charcoal%E2%98%85-Fighters-Football/dp/B06Y6FVN9G/ref=sr_1_24_sspa?keywords=odour+eater+insert&amp;#x26;qid=1558559990&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sr=8-24-spons&amp;#x26;psc=1&quot;&gt;Eco Whiff on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are designed to deodourise your shoes which makes them smell nice but they also absorb moisture. Placing these in your shoes after you play will keep your shoes dry and prevent them from smelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another alternative is this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dendron-Odoreaters-Sport-Foot-Spray/dp/B009OC3HGE/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=odour+eater+spray&amp;#x26;qid=1558559981&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sr=8-1-spons&amp;#x26;psc=1&quot;&gt;Odor-Eaters spray&lt;/a&gt;, again off Amazon. It‚Äôs more preventative than the inserts as you spray it onto your feet and like an antiperspirant, it helps stop your feet from sweating. You can use it by spraying it into your shoes to kill any odours that way too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A skipping rope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipping is an essential skill for Badminton players of all levels. It‚Äôs great to have a skipping or a speed rope in your bag ready to use for warmups or workouts. Skipping can be done anywhere, you don‚Äôt need a lot of space and it‚Äôs a quick and efficient way to get warmed up properly as it gets your pulse rate up. Good exercise for your calf strength with helps a lot with agility in Badminton you can use it in your speed and agility training schedules too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This skipping rope from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beast-Rope-Gear-Skipping-Conditioning/dp/B01FW7SSI6/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=speedrope&amp;#x26;qid=1558561197&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sr=8-3-spell&quot;&gt;Beast Rope on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is of fantastic quality. Its modern design makes it easier to skip with. It‚Äôs also adjustable so you can change the length of the rope to suit you.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The 5 Best Badminton Racquets 2019 (For Singles and Doubles)]]></title><description><![CDATA[There are plenty of articles out there listing the best Badminton racquets out now.

You‚Äôll find they all list 10-20 racquets as recommendations, that‚Äôs a lot to sift through. Truth is there isn‚Äôt normally a massive difference between a lot of racquets, only seasoned professionals can really tell the difference. This is my list of top recommended racquets, the best of the best. If you‚Äôre at more of a beginner level you‚Äôll want to look at my list for best racquets for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So which are the best Badminton racquets you can buy right now? &lt;strong&gt;My top five best Badminton racquets for 2019 are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonex Voltric Z Force 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonex Arcsaber 11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonex Duora 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victor Jetspeed S10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Li-Ning N7II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these racquets are outstanding. Some of them suit certain play styles better or are better for doubles or singles etc. If you‚Äôre not sure which Badminton racquet type is meant for you we have a guide which details everything you need to know about selecting a racquet. Let‚Äôs have a closer look at what makes these five racquets the best in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yonex Voltric Z Force 2 (The Best Singles Racquet)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released worldwide in 2014, the Yonex Voltric Z Force 2 is still one of the best racquets on the market even five years later. It was so popular with the best players in the world that there are multiple limited edition versions made. Lee Chong Wei had a purple and black colour variant when he played with it in 2014 BWF World Championships and beyond. Lin Dan had three different limited editions of this racquet in 2015, a white, coral red and yellow and black versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countless players used it including Kento Momota, Chris Adcock, Srikanth Kidambi, PV Sindhu and more. Although these players don‚Äôt use this racquet anymore I‚Äôd still argue this is still one of the best to play with now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a head heavy racquet with an extra stiff shaft so it‚Äôs ideal for singles players. Here are some pros and cons for the Yonex Voltric Z Force 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incredible power and swing speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to manoeuvre despite being head heavy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still easily available to buy and comes in various weights and grip sizes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard to control without practice and good technique&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be fatiguing to play with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve played with this racquet now for about four years, it was difficult to get used to at first. After practice and playing with it for a couple of months I started to see how much power and speed I could get in my shots with good technique. It‚Äôs an incredible racquet, there isn‚Äôt any other racquet like it. If you love hitting big smashes and speedy shots then this racquet is for you. You can buy it from various Badminton retailers or find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yonex-Voltric-Badminton-Racket-Strung/dp/B00IMWQR3C/ref=sr_1_1?crid=YG7896DM1G05&amp;#x26;keywords=yonex+voltric+z+force+2&amp;#x26;qid=1559768439&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sprefix=yonex+voltric+z+for%2Caps%2C137&amp;#x26;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;here on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yonex Arcsaber 11 (The Best All Round Doubles Racquet)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the oldest of the racquets that I recommend in this list, the Yonex Arcsaber 11 is still one of the best racquets out there. Released in 2013 a variety of doubles and singles players picked this racquet up. Players including Mathias Boe, Carsten Morgensen, Viktor Axelsen, Marc Zweibler and so on. It‚Äôs a racquet used by players who are looking for complete control in their shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A even balanced racquet with a large head shape this racquet is easy to control and hard to mishit with. Stiff shaft couples to deliver good power with enough technique and strength. It‚Äôs perfect for playing controlling shots from the front of the court and hitting fast shots from the mid and read court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light and balanced racquet, easy to play with and control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large head makes consistent clean shots easier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speedy to play driving shots with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lacking next-level kind of power for smashes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yonex Arcsaber 11 is a classic, it‚Äôs a great all rounder which makes it suitable for doubles where you need a little bit of everything. You can‚Äôt really go wrong with this racquet, it‚Äôs an all-rounder for a reason and suitable for most. You can find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yonex-ArcSaber-Badminton-Racket-Color/dp/B07659LK2X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=yonex+arcsaber+11&amp;#x26;qid=1559771776&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;here on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yonex Duora 10 (The Best All Round Racquet, Singles and Doubles)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yonex Duora 10 was the first racquet in a long time that tried to bring something very different to the Badminton racquet market. They designed the racquet head with one side that was thin and aerodynamic for speed and the other side was more boxed shaped to provide more power in shots. The idea was to use one side for backhand fast shots and the other for powerful forehand shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Voltric Z Force 2, this was an incredibly popular racquet with top players. Released back in 2015 it was used by players like Lee Chong Wei, Chou Tien Chen, Kim Astrup, Anders Rasmussen, Ng Ka Long Angus and plenty more. The incredible thing about this racquet is its versatility. We‚Äôve seen singles, doubles and mixed doubles players playing with it in the past. It‚Äôs a slightly head heavy racquet with a stiff shaft so great for almost everyone. Here are some pros and cons with the Duora 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The aerodynamic side is amazingly quick for short sharp shots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The boxed side provides solid hitting power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to play in the defence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More forgiving stiffness and balance, easier to play with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy power but feels limited compared to heavier, stiffer racquets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve played with this racquet before and you don‚Äôt need to play with it long to realise why so many people loved this racquet and still do. Although top players may have moved on this is still overall one of the best racquets you can buy. Still easily available you can find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yonex-Badminton-Racket-Color-Orange/dp/B075ZD2XXQ/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=yonex+duora+10&amp;#x26;qid=1559770267&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;here on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Victor Jetspeed S10 (The Fastest Doubles Racquet)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Victor Jetspeed S10 has long been hailed as one of the fastest doubles racquet ever. Following on from the footsteps of the Bravesword range favoured by players like Lee Yong Dae, this racquet had a lot to live up to. Released in 2014 a number of doubles players all made the jump to playing with this racquet. This included Goh V Shem and Tan Wee Kiong, Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo, Chan Peng Soon and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All top men‚Äôs doubles players they favoured the sheer speed this racquet has. A even balanced racquet with s stiff shaft it‚Äôs a good all-rounder from the start. What set this racquet apart from the rest was how quickly you could play with it. A very responsive racquet head made short racquets motions snappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So light and so speedy to play with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still delivers power in the smashes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to manoeuvre and responsive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smaller head frame, more chance to mishit the shuttle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody can argue this is still a top racquet even in 2019. Most would still favour playing with this racquet despite its age and get incredible results with it. I‚Äôd recommend this to anybody who focuses on playing doubles. If it‚Äôs good enough for the best and is easy to play with, why not? You can find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Victor-JS-10-White-Black-Blue/dp/B00WGX668E/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2OQ1GD01T9TQL&amp;#x26;keywords=victor+jetspeed+s10&amp;#x26;qid=1559771431&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sprefix=victor+jetspee%2Caps%2C138&amp;#x26;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;here on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Li-Ning N7II (Another Great All Round Racquet, Easiest to Play With)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last racquet I recommend on this is another good all-rounder. The Li-Ning N7II is a even balanced racquet with a medium flex shaft. This actually makes this racquet even easier to play with, it‚Äôs the friendliest racquet to play with from this list. It‚Äôs because of how forgiving this racquet can be that I recommend it. It‚Äôs not to say that it lacks in quality though. It has good speed, power and feels solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famously Zhang Nan used this racquet and he‚Äôs one of the best mens and mixed doubles players ever. It provides good speed for killing shots at the net and easy power when smashing due to the more flexible shaft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beautifully detailed racquet, simply stunning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good speed, power and control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even balance and medium flex makes it so easy to play with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great for frontcourt play&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has power but is limited by the flexible shaft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd say out of this list that this is the easiest to recommend. This racquet has everything and is coupled with a beautiful design. With so much quality it‚Äôs an easy buy. Find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.racketline.co.uk/badminton-c1/badminton-rackets-c5/li-ning-n7ii-ultra-sharp-turbo-n7-ii-wh-racket-p3868&quot;&gt;here on Racketline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Related questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which badminton racquet is best for smash?&lt;/strong&gt; The best racquets for smashing are head heavy racquets with stiff shafts. Some good examples are Yonex Z Force 2, Yonex Duora 10 and Yonex Astrox 99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the best weight for a badminton racket?&lt;/strong&gt; For singles players prefer to have slightly heavier racquets for carrying momentum into their shots. They tend to go for 3U weighted racquets. Doubles players go for lighter 4U racquets because they have less time from shot to shot and need lightning-fast reflexes and short sharp racquet motion. All made easier with a lighter racquet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which is the best badminton racquets for a beginner?&lt;/strong&gt; I always recommend even balanced, flexible shaft racquets for beginners. Playing with an all-around quality racquet that has a good amount of flex helps beginners by being easy to play with and easy to generate power. See our racquets for beginners guide for a list of the best racquets and why they‚Äôre good for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

It‚Äôs vital to get a good pair of quality shoes for safety and comfort. Your shoes will provide much-needed protection for your feet, legs and joints from all the pressure and impact they take from running, jumping and twisting whilst playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve only ever bought one bad pair of Badminton shoes. I didn‚Äôt have much money and got a cheap pair that weren‚Äôt very good and I ended up suffering from shin splints. I had to stop playing for a month for my legs to recover. After that, I got a top quality pair like I always did and never looked back. I would say save most of your Badminton budget to pay for the best shoes you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, not everybody has a lot of money to spend on equipment. If you‚Äôre new to the sport you might want to get some quality equipment without breaking the bank. The good news is you don‚Äôt have to, you can get quality Badminton shoes for great prices if you know which ones to buy. &lt;strong&gt;So here are the seven best Badminton shoes for any player on any budget.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adidas Essence Court Shoes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonex Power Cushion 35 Mens Badminton Shoes (Black-Blue)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mizuno Wave Fang SL Indoor Court Shoes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asics Gel Rocket 8 Mens Court Shoes (Black-White)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonex Power Cushion 03ZMX Mens Badminton Shoes (White or Coral Red)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonex Power Cushion Aerus 2 Mens Badminton Shoes (Navy, Red or Pink)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonex Power Cushion Aerus 3 Mens Badminton Shoes (Black or Blue)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list goes from lowest to highest price. All of these shoes are top quality, the prices vary as some have extra features that are nice to have but not essential. Some of these shoes are designed for more advanced players looking to gain every little advantage they can get. Let‚Äôs have a look at each pair to see what makes them great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adidas Essence Court Shoes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adidas isn‚Äôt a brand known for it‚Äôs Badminton gear. I had to include this pair on the list because my father uses them and he absolutely loves them. They‚Äôre actually designed for multiple indoor sports such as Squash, Badminton, Handball, Hockey and Volleyball. With all those sports you know you‚Äôre going to have enough protection for all kinds of activity and movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comfortable shoe that breath well thanks to Adidas‚Äô Air Mesh technology. They provide plenty of support with shock absorbing EVA technology called adiPrene in the midsole. Padded collar and tongue provide comfortable support to the foot and heel. This pair will practically pay for themselves with their durability. Adidas‚Äô adiWear technology protects the front of the shoe from drag friction to prevent tearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cheapest pair on this list they‚Äôre an absolute steal for the quality at such a low price. You‚Äôll be hard pressed to find another pair of shoes matching this quality for this price. Find them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.directbadminton.co.uk/deptproduct/badminton/mens-badminton-squash-shoes/adidas-essence-court-shoes-(mystery-ink-white)?ProductID=28027&quot;&gt;here on Direct Badminton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yonex Power Cushion 35 Mens Badminton Shoes (Black-Blue)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yonex features multiple times on this list and for good reason. Yonex makes top quality Badminton shoes. While they do tend to focus more heavily on the premium high-end pairs a bit more, their lower priced shoes offer some of the same great technology found in those shoes at a lower price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yonex Power Cushion 35 is one of those shoes. Only slightly more expensive than the Adidas Essence Court Shoes they‚Äôre in the low budget range. You get Yonex‚Äôs famous Power Cushion technology in this shoe. Power Cushion provides the best shock absorption to reduce the impact on the knees and provides rebound for increasing speed and explosive power. Combine that with Yonex‚Äôs Hexagrip sole which provides incredible grip on all surfaces and you‚Äôve got one hell of a shoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Yonex‚Äôs best technology in a budget-friendly pair of shoes. You can‚Äôt go wrong with this pair. It provides all the necessities for a Badminton shoe at a great price. Buy them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.directbadminton.co.uk/deptproduct/badminton/mens-badminton-squash-shoes/yonex-power-cushion-35-mens-badminton-shoes-(black-blue)?ProductID=28330&quot;&gt;here on Direct Badminton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mizuno Wave Fang SL Indoor Court Shoes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another brand not widely known in the Badminton community but have started to gather support. Mizuno has some top talent sporting their products such as Nozomi Okuhara, Mohammad Ahsan, Hendra Setiawan and Kenichi Hayakawa. If this brand is good enough for them it‚Äôs good enough for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mizuno Wave Fang SL has plenty of features. They have intercool ventilation technology to allow your feet to breath. They have plenty of abrasion protection for foot drag as well as a rounded bottom medial sides to smooth the drag with the trailing foot. Mizuno Wave is Mizuno‚Äôs unique technology which provides both cushioning and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all these features and more you got everything you need all in one pair of shoes. Buy them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportsshoes.com/product/miz3167/mizuno-wave-fang-sl-indoor-court-shoes/?gclid=CNuD9fPd1eICFYIa0wod8iQLdw&amp;#x26;gclsrc=aw.ds&quot;&gt;here on SportsShoes.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asics Gel Rocket 8 Mens Court Shoes (Black-White)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asics have a long history of making shoes for all kinds of sports. A proud history in innovation and a multisport brand, Asics have started to do more and more Badminton shoes. There are many pairs that could be recommended but this pair fits nicely into this list for price and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Asics Gel Rocket 8 has specialised silicone placed right at the forefront area to provide shock absorption to reduce the risk of injury. They have the Trusstic System which is a moulded component used in the mid-sole area to provide stability and control the torsion of the shoe. They have specialised rubber outsole to provide extra grip on court surfaces than regular rubber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all these shoes are a good middle-ground shoe. They have everything you need, some nice extras and come at a good price. You can buy them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.directbadminton.co.uk/deptproduct/badminton/mens-badminton-squash-shoes/asics-gel-rocket-8-mens-court-shoes-(black-white)?ProductID=32827&quot;&gt;here on Direct Badminton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yonex Power Cushion 03ZMX Mens Badminton Shoes (White or Coral Red)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pair of premium high-end Yonex shoes on this list is something special. They came out during the 2017/2018 season so they‚Äôre not the latest model in the Yonex range but they were at the time they were released. This means you can get this top of the range shoe for last seasons price! They were sported by the likes of Lee Chong Wei and Kento Momota, two players with incredible speed and footwork so you know they‚Äôd need good shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packing all the latest Yonex technology including the 3-Layer Power Cushion for ultimate impact protection and rebound power. The first pair of Badminton shoes I‚Äôve seen to have asymmetrical lacing to fit the form of the foot. This reduces the pressure applied to the top of the foot and provide a more comfortable fit. The shoe has an inner bootie to reduce overlap and pressure points on the foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yonex Power Cushion 03ZMX has everything you need and some amazing extras you never knew you needed. I have a pair of these myself and you can feel the quality through every inch of the shoe. Yonex has done something a little different and that innovative thinking makes for an incredible pair of Badminton shoes. They‚Äôre dropped at least a quarter of the price since their initial launch so are a no brainer if you have the cash. Buy them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.directbadminton.co.uk/deptproduct/badminton/mens-badminton-squash-shoes/asics-gel-rocket-8-mens-court-shoes-(black-white)?ProductID=32827&quot;&gt;here on Direct Badminton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yonex Power Cushion Aerus 2 Mens Badminton Shoes (Navy, Red or Pink)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next pair of premium Yonex shoes, the Yonex Aerus 2s, have become a worldwide favourite. These pair are the lightest pair of Yonex shoes they‚Äôve ever made. Made using a patented material that is ten times lighter than their other materials you can practically glide around the court in these shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not just for how lightweight they feel but also that they‚Äôre still very robust and surprisingly so. I have a pair that I can wear although I use them more as a spare pair now. I used these shoes for two years of training, playing and competing, singles and doubles and they‚Äôre still in good shape. They‚Äôve lasted twice as long as any other pair I‚Äôve ever owned so that‚Äôs saying something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get them a little cheaper now the newest Aerus 3 model is out and I‚Äôd encourage anyone who has the money to do so. You‚Äôll earn that money back in comfort and for how long they last. You can buy them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.directbadminton.co.uk/deptproduct/badminton/mens-badminton-squash-shoes/yonex-power-cushion-aerus-2-mens-badminton-shoes-(navy)?ProductID=27317&quot;&gt;here on Direct Badminton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yonex Power Cushion Aerus 3 Mens Badminton Shoes (Black or Blue)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Yonex Aerus 2 shoes aren‚Äôt good enough for you or you simply have more money in your pocket, the Yonex Aerus 3 shoes are for you. Improving on the amazing Aerus 2s that came before Yonex stepped it up again to get an even better shoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They went back to a design that‚Äôs more seamless like the original Yonex Aerus shoes were. Problem with the first Yonex Aerus shoes is that they were too light and too thin and suffered durability problems because of it. The Yonex Aerus 3 gets the old look back with the newer durability of the improved Aerus 2. They‚Äôve also improved the fit of the shoe as some people complained that the fit of the Aerus 2s was too narrow and tight. The last big improvement is an improved Power Cushion technology called the Power Cushion Plus. This improved version of Yonex‚Äôs shock absorption material is said to provide 25% more shock absorbency and 12% more resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these Yonex has created a nearly perfect Badminton shoe. The priciest pair of Badminton shoes probably on any list but they‚Äôre one of the best pair of Badminton shoes around. You can buy them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.directbadminton.co.uk/deptproduct/badminton/mens-badminton-squash-shoes/yonex-power-cushion-aerus-3-mens-badminton-shoes-(black)?ProductID=33376&quot;&gt;here on Direct Badminton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

You need to do a lot of work on the court with technique, tactical and physical training. But there is a lot you can do off the court to improve yourself both as a Badminton player and as a well-rounded person. I read a lot of books and make great use of Audible on my commutes to work. I‚Äôve learnt a lot from just reading books from various authors and industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the nine books I recommend Badminton players have to help them improve at Badminton:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bounce by Matthew Syed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Chimp Paradox by Steve Peters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thrive by Arianna Huffington&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Art of War by Sun Tzu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The World‚Äôs Fittest Book by Ross Edgley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lean in 15 by Joe Wicks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dare to be a Champion by Lee Chong Wei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atomic Habits by James Clear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this list, there is only one Badminton specific book and it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúhow to play Badminton‚Äù or ‚ÄúBadminton for Dummies‚Äù kind of book. I‚Äôve searched and bought a few books that are specific to Badminton and most of the information in them is either out of date or freely available elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These nine books are the top books I‚Äôd recommend to anyone and not just Badminton players. The lessons, knowledge and wisdom you gain from these books are invaluable and eye-opening. Let‚Äôs have a look at them and how they can help you improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bounce: The Myth of Talent and the Power of Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Syed, a former England table tennis player and England number one for almost a decade, knows a little bit about success in sport. He was the English national champion four times, competed at two Olympic games and was part of the team that won Gold in the men‚Äôs team event in the Commonwealth Games 2002. He‚Äôs since gone onto be an established journalist, author and commentator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His best selling book called Bounce is about dispelling the myths around innate talent and becoming the best. He believes and proves that talent is the result of thousands of hours or purposeful and deliberate practice. Talent is not something you‚Äôre born with and anybody can attain it if you work for it. He dives into the mindset of high performers and how you can learn from them to improve. He highlights that you must be able to embrace failure so that you can grow and overcome new obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a great read, he‚Äôs a fantastic author. It‚Äôs not all theory either, he gives examples and samples from research that validates his points. If you want to believe that hard work pays off this book confirms it. Practice with purpose and you‚Äôll trump those ‚Äúnaturally talented‚Äù every time. The book can be found in various formats &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bounce-Myth-Talent-Power-Practice/dp/0007350546/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=bounce&amp;#x26;qid=1558879279&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;here on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Chimp Paradox: The Mind Management Programme to Help You Achieve Success, Confidence and Happiness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chimp Paradox is a book that teaches you how to handle your emotions. It uses the analogy of the chimp to rationalise how our brain works. The chimp is the emotional, flight or fight response part of our brain, the one that reacts the fastest to any danger or situation we encounter. The human part of our brain makes rational, calculated, long term decisions. These two personas clash with each other quite often and for most people, the chimp is the one in control. This book helps readers to understand when we‚Äôre letting our chimp make bad decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing Badminton competitively, we get into high-pressure situations like being 20-19 up in the third game of a match and just about to serve. Or we can be getting pressured and scared by a really good player that makes us feel like we can‚Äôt win. Our immediate responses are controlled by the chimp and we need to be able to spot that and turn it around. If you can learn to control your emotions on the court you will become a much better player overall. Here‚Äôs the link to buy it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Chimp-Paradox-Management-Programme-Confidence/dp/009193558X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+chimp+paradox&amp;#x26;qid=1558879551&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measuring success, it‚Äôs not talked about enough. How can we call ourselves successful? How do we feel successful? If you asked people if they felt successful I bet a lot of people would say they don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs not something people think about. Thrive was written by Arianna Huffington, the founder of the Huffington Post, and in the book, she talks about our perception of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She teaches readers to ask themselves; ‚Äúare you thriving?‚Äù Are you looking after your well-being? Looking after your physical and mental health. Are you gaining wisdom? Learning on a deeper level. Do you experience wonder? Reflection on the beauty of the world and the people in it. And are you giving? Being generous to others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aspects help people to thrive. If you‚Äôre thriving then all aspects of your life improve. I know this because I‚Äôve been through periods where I wasn‚Äôt thriving and I wasn‚Äôt enjoying Badminton because of it. I started to measure success with Badminton, work and family to be my measure of success. This book showed me how I could show myself I am successful already. Part of my reason for building BadmintonsBest is to give back to others who want to enjoy, improve and get into Badminton. It‚Äôs a life-changing book. Get it here &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thrive-Redefining-Success-Creating-Happier/dp/0753555425/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=thrive&amp;#x26;qid=1558879632&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sr=8-2&quot;&gt;on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Art of War&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classic read that‚Äôs been lapped up by businesses, athletes and entrepreneurs worldwide. Written by Sun Tzu, a Chinese general from around 500 BC, the book is hailed as one of the best texts on military strategy ever. Filled with wisdom and tactics this book has so much you can put into practice on the Badminton court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court is the battlefield and the players on the other side are the enemy. You can learn to win the battle before it has begun. How to draw up a game plan by playing to your strengths and exploiting your opponent‚Äôs weaknesses. Deception, so you can make your opponent do what you want them to do. There is so much more this book offers and it‚Äôs a compelling read to boot. If you want to win the mind game in Badminton then you need this book. Available here &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/SUN-TZU-ART-WAR-2019/dp/1099066085/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=the+art+of+war&amp;#x26;qid=1558880089&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sr=8-5&quot;&gt;on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The World‚Äôs Fittest Book: The Sunday Times Bestseller from the Strongman Swimmer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weight training, endurance training, agility training, these are all vitally important things that are needed to become a great player. Badminton is an extremely physical sport. It requires strength, power, agility and speed in abundance. The better you get the more you need of each. There are a lot of myths around training for all of these aspects and this book, The World‚Äôs Fittest Book looks to dispel a lot of those myths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written by Ross Edgley, he was the first person in history to swim around the whole of Great Britain. A swim of 2000 miles that took over 157 days to do. This man knows a thing or two about fitness. Ross gained insights from Olympic and World Champions, world record holders and some of the greatest athletes in the world to make this book. The book is filled with workouts tried and tested by the best. Whether you want to lose more fat, gain muscle, boost your speed or learn how to eat better then this book has you covered in spades. Get this must-have book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Worlds-Fittest-Book-Bestseller-Strongman/dp/0751572543/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3HP0E5F84H6BQ&amp;#x26;keywords=the+worlds+fittest+book&amp;#x26;qid=1558880155&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sprefix=the+worlds+fitte%2Caps%2C175&amp;#x26;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;here on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, worth every penny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety and depression are two of the biggest challenges that current generations are facing right now. In the age of the internet, smartphones and social media more and more people are getting lost in their phones. Spending hours a day swiping and scrolling through never-ending content, we forget how to live in the here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Power of Now, written by Eckhart Tolle, teaches you how to live in the now. It gives you actions and strategies to help you stay focused on here and now to make the most of your life. How does this help with Badminton? It helps you to learn how to focus, how to really focus. The last point you just lost in gone and lingering on it won‚Äôt change it or the proceeding points. Regretting not going to training and choosing instead to stay at home to watch more Netflix. Worrying about that big match coming up which is going to be really tough. This book teaches you to deal with the present, the now. You can only control what you do now and you cannot control everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free yourself from the pain you suffer from judging your own thoughts and instead merely observing them. Get the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-Now-Guide-Spiritual-Enlightenment/dp/0340733500/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+power+of+now&amp;#x26;qid=1558880176&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;on Amazon here&lt;/a&gt; and learn to enjoy Badminton and life to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lean in 15 - The Shift Plan: 15 Minute Meals and Workouts to Keep You Lean and Healthy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody knows that to stay fit and healthy we have to exercise more and eat a well-balanced diet. We get our exercise from training and playing Badminton. It‚Äôs an easy and fun way to get the exercise we need. Our diet and eating habits are harder to correct. Sometimes we don‚Äôt know what we should be eating or how much. Sometimes we know what we should and shouldn‚Äôt be eating but just don‚Äôt know where to start. We don‚Äôt have time to cook healthy meals as it takes too long. Step in Mr Joe Wicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs imperative to have a good diet if you want to improve at Badminton. You need to fuel and nourish your body in order to grow and recover. Joe Wick‚Äôs series of books called ‚ÄúLean in 15‚Äù are great cookbooks filled with amazingly healthy and tasty recipes to suit everyone. He covers different meals including breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. He also covers recipes by diet type such as low carb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His meals are based around the idea of having them cooked in 15 minutes or less. If you‚Äôre an experienced cook or not and whatever your taste buds are like there is something in there for you. You can buy any of his three books &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-15-Minute-Workouts-Healthy/dp/1509800662/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3FH0T4CLAJ2CK&amp;#x26;keywords=lean+in+15&amp;#x26;qid=1558880212&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sprefix=lean+in%2Caps%2C142&amp;#x26;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. I like this one, one of my favourite recipes is the ‚Ä¶ give it a try, it‚Äôs amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dare to be a Champion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn‚Äôt make this list of books without including Lee Chong Wei‚Äôs autobiography. It‚Äôs not particularly long and doesn‚Äôt go into as much depth as you‚Äôd hope but it gives you a glance into the legends life so far. His story is inspiring and that‚Äôs exactly why I included it in this list. There are no tips or tricks only the lesson of knowing what it took for a legend to become a legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how the best got to where they are can highlight what you could change to try and help you improve at Badminton. It‚Äôs a nice little book and every Badminton fan who knows the Malaysians name should have one. Get inside the mind of the champion and have a read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it‚Äôs getting to the gym more, or choosing the fruit over the chocolate, or getting rid of that bad habit of getting caught flat-footed on court, habits are powerful. Atomic Habits is a definitive guide on how to break bad behaviours and adopt new and good ones. By making small and incremental improvements through everyday routines you can make a big difference over the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers state that about 40% of our behaviour is driven by habit. So there‚Äôs no denying how powerful habits are. I used the book‚Äôs guidelines and developed several habits that have helped me produce this website, improve significantly in Badminton over the last few years and generally improve my life. Buy this book on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/1847941834/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=atomic+habits&amp;#x26;qid=1558880355&amp;#x26;s=gateway&amp;#x26;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Amazon here&lt;/a&gt;, it‚Äôs a great price for knowledge on how to make a positive change that sticks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Best Badminton Gear - Tried and Tested Recommendations]]></title><description><![CDATA[Over the years of playing Badminton, I‚Äôve bought, used and tried a lot of different Badminton gear.

Everything including racquets, shuttlecocks, shoes, clothing, bags, grips, strings. You name it and I‚Äôve probably tried it. My preferences in equipment have changed as I‚Äôve grown up with the sport so I know what suits beginners and what suits more advanced players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve also bought from multiple brands so I know how the same product from two different brands can be different. As I‚Äôve progressed and advanced in the sport I‚Äôve even collated a list of books and resources I believe anyone looking for self-improvement and improvement in Badminton should read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note, these recommendations are from my own personal experience. I‚Äôve tried or owned all the items on these lists so the recommendations are genuine. Some of these recommendations are budget-friendly and some are indulgences but they‚Äôre what I believe provides the best value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

Without an explanation, it‚Äôs hard to take a guess at what it could mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is gutting in Badminton? &lt;strong&gt;Gutting is just a Badminton term for restringing your racquet. Often used when buying a new racquet, the seller might ask if you want it ‚Äúgutted‚Äù which means to take the strings out and replace them with your own choice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it‚Äôs just a term for restringing your racquet. So why might you want to ‚Äúgut‚Äù your racquet? And how often should you gut your racquet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gutting/restringing your racquet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the word &lt;em&gt;gutting&lt;/em&gt; is just a Badminton term for restringing. You can have this done when buying a new racquet. Most reputable sellers will offer the option to restring your new racquet with a string of your choice and tension. The factory strings that racquets come with tend to be very basic and not string very highly. For beginners, the factory strings may suffice for a while but better players should definitely have them replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs called gutting because you‚Äôre essentially removing the insides of the racquet. Grotesque description yes but that‚Äôs essentially why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutting your racquet is necessary whenever the strings break or they begin to fray. You can‚Äôt play Badminton with a broken string in your racquet. It‚Äôs impossible to hit with any consistency and the shuttle could actually go through your racquet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strings can snap for a number of reasons. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold weather.&lt;/strong&gt; Strings are made to be elastic. If your racquets have been stored in a very cold environment then the strings are going to be cold. The strings are likely to snap when put under pressure as they become harder when cold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hitting off the sweet spot.&lt;/strong&gt; When stringing to high tensions, 27-28lbs and over, it‚Äôs easy to break a string when hitting the shuttle off the sweet spot. The sweet spot is the optimal spot on the racquet to hit the shuttle. Hitting off the sweet spot puts more pressure on the strings near the edge of the frame. The strings get stretched under more pressure and will eventually give way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damaged grommets.&lt;/strong&gt; Grommets are the plastic inserts that sit in the holes that strings pass through. They protect the racquet from the strings digging into it. Grommets can get worn over time as they bear the weight of the tension. If the grommet has split of frayed it will be sharp enough to cut through the string when pressure is applied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General wear and tear and notching.&lt;/strong&gt; When the same strings have been used for a while they begin to fray. This is through general wear and tear. Depending on the frequency of playing and how you hit the shuttle it might take a while to see strings start to fray. The strings fray because they constantly rub against each other. No matter how tightly the strings are done they will always shift and rub against each other. This natural friction wears out the strings over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restringing a racquet involves taking out all the old string and replacing with new ones. The process of stringing requires a stringing machine stand, the choice of Badminton string and a number of specialised small tools. To learn more about stringing, the equipment needed and how to do it see our full article here. Below is a good video demonstrating how a racquet is restrung.&lt;/p&gt;

          &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;h2&gt;How often should I restring my racquet?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what if you don‚Äôt manage to break the strings on your racquet? If you‚Äôre playing with low tension or using thicker strings they might last you a long time. If you don‚Äôt play regularly then the wear and tear won‚Äôt happen. People ask this because they can see the strings starting to fray or they feel some of the tension in the strings has been lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strings are elastic and naturally, over time, will lose their tension. The tension the strings are under stretches them and over time they can‚Äôt retain their original shape or length. In the trade, this is called string creep. This can be minimised if the string is pre-stretched before stringing the racquet. This ensures any creep the string might have is mostly taken out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would always recommend restringing your racquet when it starts to noticeably fray. If the strings are fraying it‚Äôs only a matter of time before one shot will snap them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For beginners and intermediate players, the loss of tension in the strings will mostly go unnoticed. More advanced players, however, will start to notice when the strings lose their tension. Playing with slacker strings then you‚Äôre used to can affect your play. The size of the sweet spot will be widened and you‚Äôll have less precise control with your shots. An easy way to test if the string has lost tension is to compare it with sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take two racquets, strung with the same string and tension, use one to lightly tap the strings of the other one and listen to the sound it makes. When the strings are tight you‚Äôll hear a higher pitch, sharper sound then at a lower tension. Having two strung the same you‚Äôll notice a difference in sound if the one you‚Äôre playing with is losing tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why should I change my strings regularly?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already mentioned that loss of tension over time can affect your Badminton. Why else would you want to change your strings regularly if they aren‚Äôt broken?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To try a new kind of string.&lt;/strong&gt; It‚Äôs beneficial as you start to get better at Badminton to try different things. Try different kinds of racquets, shuttles, shoes and strings to see what suits you best. As you evolve as a player the things you used yesterday won‚Äôt always best for you tomorrow. As you become a more accomplished player you‚Äôll have found what works for you but even then there is always more to be learned and tried. Different strings have different characteristics and some are better for certain ways of playing than others. To get a full breakdown on selecting the best strings for you see our guide here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To try and different tension.&lt;/strong&gt; As well as trying different kinds of strings it‚Äôs important bas you get better to test if you get more benefit from a higher tension. Higher tensions give you more precise control when hitting the shuttle but make it harder to generate power for fast shots like smashes. Our stringing guide also covers string tension and the myth of tighter strings mean and bigger smash here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where can I get my racquet restrung?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a stringing machine and all the equipment, chances are you already know how to string a racquet. But what if you don‚Äôt? It‚Äôs best to find someone local and reliable who is trained and has experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you play at a Badminton club, in a league for a team then ask people where they get their racquets strung. Everyone needs them doing at some point and it‚Äôs always good to get a recommendation based on experience. Most Badminton clubs have somebody who can string a racquet or know someone who can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can‚Äôt get a recommendation from someone or they‚Äôre not local to you then Google will be your next best bet. Search for ‚Äúbadminton stringing near me‚Äù and if people have a business setup, a website or a sports shop that does stringing then they should turn up in the search. Also, check your national Badminton federation website for a section on accredited stringers. Some federations might have a database list of people who are accredited for stringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre struggling to find anything on Badminton specific on Google then try general sports stores or racquet sports stores. For example, some Tennis shops do stringing but the same stringing machine might also be able to string a Badminton racquet. It‚Äôs worth visiting to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Related questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is grommet flaring?&lt;/strong&gt; Grommet flaring is the process of spreading the grommets straight end, the end that is on the inside of the racquet head. Flaring the grommet is usually done for the place where the string is knotted so the knot has somewhere to sit. It‚Äôs not recommended for the other grommets as they‚Äôll be difficult to remove once flared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I replace the factory string on my new racquet?&lt;/strong&gt; I would recommend replacing the factory string for almost everyone. The string and tension racquets come with from the factory are very cheap and not done to a high standard. For an absolute beginner or recreational player, these should suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

They want to improve their smash to feel like they can win more points. I understand the jump smash in Badminton is exciting. When you hit a jump smash just right it feels really good. Even better if you manage to win the point. Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation out there regarding strings and tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So which is the best Badminton string for smashing? &lt;strong&gt;One of the best strings for smashing on the market right now is Yonex‚Äôs Aerosonic strings. They‚Äôre the thinnest string in the world and have incredible repulsion power. For a more powerful smash you want a thin string with high repulsion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yonex Aerosonic is just one example of a Badminton string that is great for smash power. Picking the right string isn‚Äôt a simple one choice answer though. Let‚Äôs have a look at other strings available and why they‚Äôre all good choices for hard-hitting players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The best qualities in a string for smashers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Badminton smash is the most exciting shot in the game. It requires racquet speed and good timing to get the most out of it. What attributes does a string need to give us the most amount of power?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A thin gauge.&lt;/strong&gt; The gauge is the diameter measurement of the string. Basically how thick it is. A thinner string is better for generating more power because the force of hitting the shuttle is spread over a smaller surface area. The smaller surface area puts the strings under more force and they will stretch. This will provide more power when they bounce back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soft feeling&lt;/strong&gt;. Contrary to popular belief, softer feeling strings will give you more power. They will stretch easier than harder feeling strings giving more repulsion. Hard feeling strings will give you better feedback on more delicate shots but they‚Äôre less durable for smashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High repulsion.&lt;/strong&gt; Repulsion in strings is measured by how quickly they return back to normal. Strings are elastic and they stretch when under pressure. You want strings that snap back quickly after you hit the shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other things to consider for selecting a string&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not all about getting the most powerful smash you can though. There‚Äôs no point choosing a string like Yonex Aerosonic or Yonex BG66 Force if you‚Äôre a beginner and unable to hit the shuttle in the sweet spot consistently. You‚Äôll break your strings more regularly when really you need something durable and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durability becomes an issue with thinner strings. They don‚Äôt withstand as much wear and tear that thicker strings can. Playing with a thin string will get very expensive if you‚Äôre breaking them often. Not to mention that you‚Äôll have to have a few spares in the bag for when one does break. You can get a better balance of power and durability with other strings such as Yonex‚Äôs BG80 Power. I play with this and it has great repulsion but stands more wear and tear then the thinner strings I‚Äôve used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The softer feeling strings make softer shots feel less precise. You get a trampoline effect from softer strings which gives you easier power. But when playing a net shot for example it‚Äôs harder to feel all the impact of the shuttle making it harder to get the shot just right. Hard strings give you more feedback when hitting. It‚Äôs like wearing either very running shoes or running barefoot. When you run in shoes it‚Äôs easier on your joints and it feels comfortable but running in bare feet you‚Äôll feel the ground and all the texture and get more sensory feedback than with shoes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like we mentioned, Badminton is not just all about power. It‚Äôs a game of precision and ability. Some players play-styles aren‚Äôt suited for all out smashing and offensive play. Some players do better when playing more technical shots and using good tactics and strategy. Some strings have qualities that lend themselves to these players such as Yonex‚Äôs Aerobite. This string has a rough texture that grips the shuttle more on impact which makes it easier to spin the shuttle more for slices and tumbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So rather than select a Badminton string based on power for one shot, consider how you play and you experience level before choosing. Also, don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment with different strings types and brands etc to find what‚Äôs best for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What tension is best for smashing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common myth in Badminton is that tighter strings give you more power when smashing. This just isn‚Äôt the case. Slacker strings give you more power more easily then the tighter strings will. Slacker strings give a bigger trampoline effect when you hit the shuttle. The strings are able to stretch more and then snap back to their original position with more force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems logical that tighter string would mean the shuttle would bounce back quicker right? This is quite reasonable to think and is totally correct. However, most players don‚Äôt generate enough power in their swing to make the strings stretch as much as they can. If the strings are already very tight then you have to exert even more force to get them to stretch and rebound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the average player, the best tension would be 24-27 pounds of tension. This is a nice middle ground where the strings are tight enough to have a good feel but also slack enough to make generating power in smashes and other shots efficient. For more advanced players then tensions of 29-30+ pounds will provide some extra power if they have the playing strength to be able to harness it but it‚Äôs not a massive difference. Tighter strings are more beneficial for accuracy and feeling the shot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some of the best strings I recommend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played with Yonex BG65 To strings for a long time and was very happy with them. It wasn‚Äôt until I was trying someone new to string my racquet that they recommended me to try another string. Seeing how I played and knowing roughly what my standard was they recommended I try the BG80 Power strings at a slightly higher tension then what I was playing with. It was a great recommendation and I‚Äôve never gone back. I‚Äôve tried others before and since then and have asked other players what they use. So here is my list of strings I‚Äôd recommend for getting more out of your smash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonex BG80 Power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonex BG66 Force.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonex Aerosonic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashaway ZyMax Fire 66.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Related questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the best Badminton racquet for smashing?&lt;/strong&gt; It‚Äôs commonly noted that head heavy racquets are the best for smashing power. The extra momentum generated by the racquet head creates more power when coupled with good technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often should I restring my Badminton racquet?&lt;/strong&gt; It‚Äôs best to restring whenever the strings start to fray or when there is a noticeable drop in tension. Frayed strings will break sooner or later and a loss of tension will affect your shot precision.&lt;/p&gt;

A good short serve can give you an advantage from the start of the rally. Here we‚Äôll be talking mainly about the backhand serve in relation to doubles. To learn how to improve the forehand short serve then click here to our article covering that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you improve a short serve in Badminton? &lt;strong&gt;Here is a summarised list of steps you can take to improve your short serve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stand close to the line, gain more ground&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a serving routine, consistency is key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a very short grip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hit the shuttle off the sweet spot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squeeze with the thumb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for the ‚ÄúT‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep it simple and practice, practice, practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most players never realise that will small adjustments you can make drastic improvements to their serve. If you want to learn these tips and improve your serve then read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article looks at how to improve the serve. If you want to learn the backhand short serve in more detail please click here for our article covering the technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Stand close to the line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badminton is a game of small margins. The speed of the game requires quick reactions and even quicker decision making. When you see the best doubles players serve they stand right up at the front on their box in the corner adjacent to the receiving area. The idea of this is to decrease the distance the shuttle needs to travel from their box to their opponent‚Äôs box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should aim to stand as close to the line as possible without stepping on the line, this is a fault when serving. You want to serve and get the shuttle over the net and dropping as soon as possible to give the opponent less time to react and attack the serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In singles, it‚Äôs a little different. Most singles players stand a stride or two away from the front line to serve, even when serving short. This is because they don‚Äôt have a partner covering the back if the opponent lifts or pushes the shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doubles, you want to stand as close to the line as possible. Also, try and reach out with your arms as much as you can when serving to gain even more ground. This is completely legal and you see players like Zhang Nan do this really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Have a serving routine, consistency is key&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short serve is a difficult shot to play well not just because of the accuracy needed but because there‚Äôs normally a lot of pressure from the opposition. A loose short serve will be punished by good players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to keep a consistently tight serve is to have a routine. Keep your setup the same every time. Everything from how to hold the shuttle, where you stand, how long you take in the service motion, how high you hold the shuttle, everything. Another great example of this in the elite game is Lee Yong Dae. He has a very specific routine he does before he serves. Other players know this and clever players try to disrupt his rhythm by delaying being ready etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to be relaxed when you‚Äôre about to serve. Having a routine will help relax you as you‚Äôll feel 100% ready when it comes to actually deliver the serve. Badminton is a mental game as much as it is a physical game, so take the pressure off by being ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Have a very short grip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most coaches will tell you to have a short grip when serving. This is because the shorter the grip you have the more control you have over racquet. It‚Äôs a bit like hammering nails. If you hold the hammer at the end of the handle and hit the nail you‚Äôll hit it very hard but it will be difficult to control the hammer and hit the nail dead on. If you hold the hammer nearer the top of the handle you won‚Äôt hit the nail as hard but it‚Äôs much easier to hit the nail and not miss. You have more control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So having a short grip is key but the short grip you have when you play normal rally shots and the short grip you have when serving can be slightly different. When playing rally shots you want your grip to be, at most, up to the top of your grip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When serving backhand short serve it can help to go even shorter and rest your thumb on the throat (the triangular cap that connects the handle to the shaft). The throat has a flat surface so it‚Äôs easy to grip. Because you‚Äôre essentially holding the actual racquet and not the handle, you‚Äôll get even more tactile feedback when hitting the shuttlecock. You‚Äôll feel the serve it more as you hit because the racquet handle and grip can‚Äôt dampen the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it and practice your serve with this very short grip. Even with this grip you‚Äôll be able to do a flick serve as well. Despite holding the racquet very short you can still get a lot of distance hitting the shuttle with less effort. Some people find it a lot easier to flick with this short grip because there is less racquet momentum needed. You provide more power with the power of your thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Hit the shuttle off the sweet spot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something that is relatively unknown when serving, especially in western countries that play Badminton. Hitting the shuttle off the sweet spot will give you a more consistent serve then hitting the shuttle cleanly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sweet spot is the area on the racquet where you‚Äôll get the most power return when hitting the shuttlecock. It‚Äôs normally a little higher up than the middle of the racquet head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hit the shuttle off the sweet spot you‚Äôll get less repulsion from the strings. You‚Äôre hitting with an area of the strings with less tension and this is the key. Putting less energy into the shuttle makes it easier to not over hit the serve. It might take a little while to get used to if you haven‚Äôt tried this before, but trust me, it helps a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathias Boe of Denmark is a great example of using the technique at the highest level of men‚Äôs doubles. If you look closely when he‚Äôs serving he hits the shuttle near the top of the racquet head. This is a good spot to use. Another good spot is to hit the shuttle on the strings near the top side of the racquet, this has the same effect. See images below for examples of both hitting zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Squeeze with the thumb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see it a lot with beginners, they use a lot of arm and elbow movement to deliver the serve. This isn‚Äôt necessary. The backhand short serve should be as simple and replicable as possible. If you add a lot of movement into the serve then there is more room for error. All the effort you need to deliver the shot comes from the grip of the thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding the racquet loose but firm you should have enough that when you ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù the grip you can hit the shuttle. It doesn‚Äôt need a lot of speed or backswing. Bend the elbow back slightly to bring the racquet back then forwards and squeeze the thumb lightly to hit the serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Aim for the ‚ÄúT‚Äù‚Ä¶ sometimes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we‚Äôve talked about how to improve the actual technical part of the backhand short serve. But what‚Äôs just as important as how to serve is where to serve. All coaches would teach people to serve to the ‚ÄúT‚Äù. The T is the spot where the front service line connects to the middle service line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the optimal spot for serving in doubles because it creates the shortest distance between the server and the opposition‚Äôs box. This means less time for the opponent to react. It almost limits the angles the opponent can return with. When you serve to the T accurately then every shot the opponent plays has to go past the front player because the front player is stood right in front of where they‚Äôve just served too. This makes it difficult to gain any advantage when returning the serve. This is why you see top players push and attack the serve so aggressively because the other possible returns they can play are more difficult and less advantageous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are times when we want to vary the service placement though. If the opponent is very good at attacking the serve even when you or your partner is serving well then you might need to vary the placement. You should always aim to serve and land the shuttle as close as possible to the front service line. Variation should be where along that line you aim for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiming your serve to the T, the middle of the service line and into the tram lines will produce a different response from the opponent. Opponents quick on the serve when being served to the T might struggle to get the wide serve (serving and aiming for the outer tram lines). Use these variations to try and persuade the opponent into producing a specific return you can anticipate. Serving wide might make somebody play the return with a forehand instead of backhand, serving at the body might catch someone off guard etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Keep it simple and practice, practice, practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like anything we want to get better at, deliberate practice is the key. The best Badminton servers in the world are the best because they are consistent and practice a lot. Gail Emms has been quoted to practising her serve with 1000 shuttles every day. That is how important the serve is and what it takes to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So take some time in your training and practice to improve your serve. Practice varying the placement, practice the grip and don‚Äôt throw in the towel without giving yourself the chance to see improvement. Improvement doesn‚Äôt happen overnight, it‚Äôs gradual. You might have to take two steps back before you can take one step forward but it‚Äôs better than getting stuck with bad habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Syed is a British journalist, author and broadcaster. He was the English number one table tennis player for years. In Matthew Syed‚Äôs book Bounce (affiliate link) he talks about what it takes to be the best and looks at world beaters like David Beckham and Serena Williams. He has this quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúEricsson has said. ‚ÄúExpert practice is different. It entails considerable, specific, and sustained efforts to do something you can‚Äôt do well‚Äîor even at all. Research across domains shows that it is only by working at what you can‚Äôt do that you turn into the expert you want to become.‚Äù So far the focus in this book has been on the quantity of practice required to reach the top, and we‚Äôve seen that it‚Äôs a staggering amount of time, stretching for a period of at least ten years.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äî &lt;cite&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew Syed, Bounce: Mozart, Federer, Picasso, Beckham, and the Science of Success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I‚Äôm new and/or don‚Äôt know how to serve backhand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case, we‚Äôve got you covered! We have a fully detailed article on the backhand short serve here. Being new to the sport of never having performed a certain shot makes it easier to learn a new technique the right way, the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badminton is an ever-evolving sport and players and coaches are always looking at ways to improve the game. The Badminton serve is something that has evolved a lot of the history of the sport and it‚Äôs still changing now. Here are some of the more advanced techniques I‚Äôve seen players use or start to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Toppling Serve&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people agree that this serve was first invented by Lee Yong Dae of Korea and years after you see more and more players starting to use it. Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo of Indonesia has started to use it and it‚Äôs becoming more popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toppling serve a short backhand serve that makes the shuttle spin and topple when passing over the net. This makes it difficult to return as the receiver has more chance of mishitting the shuttle whilst it‚Äôs spinning around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs inspired from what is famously known as the S Serve or the Sidek Serve. The S Serve was invented by a famous Indonesian doubles player called Misbun Sidekick. One of three brothers who played at the highest level of Badminton. The S Serve resulted in a changing of the ruleset to effectively ban this type of serve. It involved holding the shuttlecock by the cork and hitting the feathers when serving. This made the shuttle spin incredibly erratically and was nearly impossible to return when done right. For more about the S Serve see our article talking about the history of it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toppling serve is inspired by the S serve but is legal in today‚Äôs game. You serve the shuttle with a normal backhand short serve, you hold the shuttle by the feathers etc everything is the same. The only difference is that when you serve you need to chop the shuttle. Chopping the shuttle means hitting the cork first but then follow through by striking the feathers after. It‚Äôs like playing a spin net shot where you topple the shuttle. Below is a video with Sukamuljo using this serve.&lt;/p&gt;

          &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;h3&gt;The Sliced Serve&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too different from the toppling serve. The sliced serve is a less extreme variant of the backhand short serve. It involves hitting the shuttle by slicing the shuttle underneath. The idea is to create more spin when the shuttle flies to make it drop faster. This is an easier technique to conquer than the toppling serve but still very effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the sliced serve well decreases the amount of time the shuttle is travelling upwards. Making the shuttle come down faster once crossing the net makes it harder for opponents to attack the serve when it‚Äôs dropping below net height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Related questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the short service line in Badminton?&lt;/strong&gt; The short service line is the line adjacent the net at the front of the court. Every serve, including doubles and singles, must pass this line to be considered ‚Äúin‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a serve in Badminton?&lt;/strong&gt; The serve is the beginning of the rally. There are backhand and forehand serves, there are short and long serves. It‚Äôs the shot that starts off every rally. One person must serve from their own box to the diagonally opposite box of their opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you smash a serve in Badminton?&lt;/strong&gt; It‚Äôs possible to play a smash from a high serve in Badminton. If the other player is serving short or serving low then it‚Äôs going to be nearly impossible to play a smash. If the opponent serves high enough for you to smash it then it‚Äôs perfectly legal to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

As soon as I started to get better and my father started taking me to a coach, we were advised I get a proper set of Badminton shoes. All sports have specialised footwear designed for the needs of that sport. I was just using my normal trainers for playing Badminton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So can you wear Tennis shoes for Badminton? &lt;strong&gt;The simple is yes you can but it‚Äôs not advised. Some Tennis shoes are designed for all court types such as grass, clay etc but some are designed for one court surface like grass. These wouldn‚Äôt be suitable for indoor Tennis let alone Badminton. Some Tennis shoes aren‚Äôt designed to be non-marking either so they wouldn‚Äôt be allowed indoors either. They also have a lot more padding in the heel which makes using them for Badminton difficult when you need to lean back for overhead shots.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would always recommend everyone playing Badminton to have Badminton specific shoes. They offer lots of benefits and there are shoes for every person and every budget. Let‚Äôs look closer at why Tennis shoes aren‚Äôt a good fit and why Badminton specific shoes are so worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Tennis shoes are not recommended&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying but Tennis shoes are designed for Tennis, go figure. It might be obvious but what specifically about Tennis shoes makes them suited for Tennis and not Badminton?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly Tennis requires a lot of lateral movement (moving side to side). Tennis requires a lot of running along the baseline and you don‚Äôt often have to run forwards to the net or backwards. So Tennis shoe grip is designed to grip more for this lateral movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second difference is that Tennis shoes have a more heavily padded and raise heel like running shoes. This is to support the joints on impact as you run. Tennis footwork is more running than anything else whereas Badminton you chasse more. There are a few instances in Badminton when you run but they‚Äôre less common. Tennis shoes are overall a lot heavier than Badminton shoes. You‚Äôll want to feel light on your feet when playing Badminton and shoes that feel heavy won‚Äôt help with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned Tennis is played on a variety of court surfaces which include grass, clay and hardcourts. Some Tennis shoes are designed for a particular surface to allow for more grip or less. The soles of Tennis shoes can be harder or softer than Badminton shoe soles depending on which court surface they‚Äôre intended for. It‚Äôs not often Tennis isn‚Äôt often played indoors on a wooden surface so they don‚Äôt make the shoe soles out of non-marking rubber as it‚Äôs not needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last difference in Tennis shoes is arguably the most important. The grip patterns on Tennis and Badminton shoes are very different. Because Badminton has you moving in all directions the grip patterns are designed to be radial. They grip strongly in whichever direction friction is applied. Tennis shoes have a variety of grip patterns. Clay court shoes usually have herringbone tread pattern (a zig-zag like pattern) that stops clay getting lodged. It also allows for controlled sliding whilst still giving grip. Grass court shoes have a pimply pattern and are only suitable for grass courts. They provide a lot of grip because grass is the most slippery court surface for Tennis. Used on other surfaces and they‚Äôd grip too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can I wear Squash or any indoor shoes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Tennis shoes, Squash shoes are ok for Badminton. Squash has similar footwork and movements as Badminton. Squash requires speed and lots of changing direction much like Badminton. The shoes are designed for indoor use and the same grip patterns as Badminton shoes do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most styles of Squash shoes can be used for Badminton without a problem. Other general indoor shoes can be suitable but some may lack the ankle support you see often in good Badminton or Squash shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Badminton shoes, what‚Äôs special about them?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes shoes designed for Badminton special? It depends on the brand and model you go for but all Badminton specific shoes have radial grip patterns. This grip pattern allows for good grip when stressed in any direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some models of shoes have either a layer of stiff material or what they call ‚Äútalons‚Äù down the side of the shoe. These are designed to create stability for the foot and to prevent rolling. There is a lot of lateral movement in Badminton and these help players keep their footing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yonex designed the lightest pair of Badminton shoes in the world with the Aerus models. The weight of the shoe is key for fast footwork. They‚Äôre also designed to fit the shape of the foot very snuggly. Wearing a good pair of Badminton shoes feels like wearing no shoes at all sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor detail but Badminton shoes are also designed to be breathable. Getting sweaty feet isn‚Äôt great at any time but during Badminton, your feet can start to slide around in the shoes more and you‚Äôre more likely to get blisters. Wearing the right socks and a good pair of breathable shoes will help lick the moisture away from your feet and stay dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The best Badminton shoes for every budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of great Badminton brands out there. More sports brands typically known for other sports have started to dip their toes in Badminton gear as well. With brands like Yonex Victor, Li-Ning, Babolat, Yehlex and even Adidas there is a shoe out there for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve personally always had Yonex shoes and only one model I‚Äôve ever owned has been a dud. They promptly removed the model from the line due to a manufacturing error. Every pair I‚Äôve had before and since have been superb and good quality for money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs have a look at the best top of the range Badminton shoes out there currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Top of the range (most expensive)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yonex Power Cushion Aerus 3 Shoes are one of the priciest shoes on the market. Made by the world famous brand Yonex, you can count on good quality from this pair. I‚Äôve had the Aerus 2 shoes and have been by far the best pair of Badminton shoes I‚Äôve ever had. This newer version improves on the previous model being even lighter and enhancing the durability of the shoe. They have all the latest features you‚Äôd want in Badminton shoes. They have great cushioning to support on impact, they‚Äôre light, they fit the foot to prevent sliding and they have excellent grip among other features. This pair costs ¬£109.99/$145.34 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.directbadminton.co.uk/bproduct?ProductID=33376&quot;&gt;at Direct Badminton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Middle of the range (balance between cost and features)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yonex Power Cushion 03ZM Shoes are another great pair from Yonex. They look great, have more than enough support for the feet, excellent cushioning. They‚Äôre specially designed for the laces to fit the shape of the foot better and reduce the pressure put on the upper foot from the laces. They‚Äôve been discounted quite heavily since they‚Äôre a model from the 2018 catalogue. They cost ¬£79.99/$105.70 currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.directbadminton.co.uk/bproduct?ProductID=31425&quot;&gt;at Direct Badminton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The low end of the range (the cheapest, best for beginners without sacrificing quality)&lt;/h3&gt;

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever met someone who is coordinated with both hands. Things like writing and drawing etc people only do it with one hand. Their left or right. Be some gifted people can do them with both hands. So what if those people played a sport like Badminton, Tennis or Squash? Could they play with either hand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another question would then be. Can Badminton be played with both hands? &lt;strong&gt;Yes, you can! There is no rule for Badminton that says you cannot play with both hands. During my research, I have yet to find a sport of any kind that doesn‚Äôt allow switching of hands. Tennis, Table Tennis, Cricket, Baseball and even martial arts allow it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can understand why someone would ask the question. It‚Äôs completely fair if you can play racquet sports with both hands. It can be a big advantage. Let‚Äôs have a look at hand switching more closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hand switching/ambidextrous Badminton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the entire population, only one percent of people are ambidextrous while ten percent are left-handed and the rest are right handed. Being ambidextrous or not comes from the brain. People who are right-handed have left-brain dominance whereas ambidextrous people‚Äôs brains are symmetrical. Being truly ambidextrous is being equally adapted at using both the right and left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more people who claim to be ambidextrous who are actually not. They are what‚Äôs called mixed-handed. They can use both hands for the same task but still have a dominant hand. It‚Äôs also quite common for ambidextrous people to start off left-handed but become ambidextrous over time. This happens because a lot of tools we use are designed for right-handed people. Things like scissors, pens and notebooks are all ergonomically designed for being held in the right hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So being ambidextrous sounds like a good thing right off the bat right? Let‚Äôs outline some advantages it can have in Badminton:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don‚Äôt have a backhand or a forehand side.&lt;/strong&gt; If you‚Äôre able to switch hands during the rally then you can play forehand, or backhand, on either side! That would really confuse the opponent!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play any shot from the net forehand.&lt;/strong&gt; You won‚Äôt need to step across and use your backhand, you can just switch hands and play it with a forehand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like reasonable logic right? Most people would prefer to play most shots forehand or backhand. Such as smashing, if you could smash on your forehand side every time it‚Äôs more effective. Or playing defence, most people prefer to use the backhand to defend. It sounds logical but can it work in practice? Here are the possible disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody at the top level has ever played switching hands.&lt;/strong&gt; Throughout my research, I‚Äôve never found a player to play whilst switching hands. A result of this is that nobody would know how to coach someone who would want to play this way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switching hands during a fast rally would be really difficult.&lt;/strong&gt; Badminton is a fast game, sometimes you have less than seconds to react. Switching hands would require time to see the shuttle and then also to choose whether to switch hands or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confused coordination.&lt;/strong&gt; Switching hands constantly might confuse the opponent but is more likely to confuse yourself. Footwork is different for left and right-handed players so coordinating footwork will be difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From analysis and using common sense, there doesn‚Äôt look to be much benefit from being able to switch hands. However, with it being so uncommon nobody can say for sure that it couldn‚Äôt work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two-handed grip?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see in Tennis that a lot of players, including the elite players, play some shots with a two-handed grip. Is this any use in Badminton? Not really. You mostly see players use two hands to play backhand shots in Tennis. This is to stabilise the racquet more upon hitting the ball. A Tennis racquet and ball is much heavier than a Badminton racquet and shuttlecock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a lot harder in practice to play a Tennis backhand one handed and still control the ball then if you used one hand. Most players are taught to play two-handed as it‚Äôs easier and more common. The same can‚Äôt be said for Badminton. The racquets and shuttles are much lighter so the impact of playing shots doesn‚Äôt need a lot of bracing behind them  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more range of motions and strokes in Badminton from both the forehand and backhand sides. You play shots from high, low, wide and in front of you. This requires more reach and flexibility. If you have both hands on the racquet you can‚Äôt naturally extend yourself to reach the shuttle. It‚Äôs a big disadvantage for no gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can you use two racquets?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting question. During my research, I couldn‚Äôt find any solid evidence that playing with two racquets at the same time is illegal. Feasibly if you‚Äôre truly ambidextrous, or just very confident, you could play with two racquets, one in each hand. There is no explicit law against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennis has a law that prohibits using two racquets at the same time. Badminton has no such rule. The only caveat I could see is that the rules state racquet, the singular. Anyone could interpret this as only using one racquet, but without an explicit rule, it‚Äôs a grey area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be advantageous to have two racquets. Playing with one in each hand means you can play forehand shots from anywhere. You don‚Äôt have to worry about switching hands either. Specific strategies can be devised for having two in possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are obvious disadvantages too. Holding two racquets leaves you with no hands-free to balance. You‚Äôll have to carry both which might start to be fatiguing when you have to raise both but only use one. Diving defensive shots would be difficult without possibly injuring yourself. Nobody plays with two racquets again so it‚Äôs new ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of the disadvantages outweighing any possible advantages of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Examples in other sports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at any racquet or batting sports, switching hands is still a rarity but you do see cases of it. Baseball is a sport where being ambidextrous is very advantageous. Either batting or bowling it‚Äôs very useful. It‚Äôs advantageous for batters because it‚Äôs statically better to bat left-handed against a right-handed pitcher and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lacrosse is another sport where hand switching is an advantage. Offensive players who are ambidextrous are harder to defend against being able to lead either right or left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table Tennis and Tennis have some great examples of hand switching being an advantage. I‚Äôve managed to find more examples in these sports than most others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table Tennis requires a lot of quick reactions and a delicate touch. It‚Äôs a fast game much like Badminton in this video you can see how switching hands can work really well. Some points would be over if they had not switched hands!&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, Tennis. The pace of Tennis can be relentless at the top level. But the time between the shot being played and the ball getting to you is a lot more than Badminton. The long distance the ball needs to travel gives the player more time to react. In this time it‚Äôs easy to switch your racquet to your other hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria Sharapova is probably the most famous player who is known to be ambidextrous. She‚Äôs shown on multiple occasions that she can play equally with both hands. She still chooses to be a dominant right handed though. She tends to switch hands only when she‚Äôd otherwise struggle to play the shot. The video below is a good collection of footage.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;p&gt;Another example from Tennis but a lesser known player, Cheong-eui Kim solely plays forehand on each side. He switches his racquet on every shot. It looks odd but works very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Am I allowed to switch my racquet?&lt;/strong&gt; You are allowed to switch your racquet in Badminton. If you have broken a string, broken you racquet or for any other reason are unhappy with it, you may change your racquet. As long as you have another to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I switch my racquet mid-rally?&lt;/strong&gt; You can switch your racquet mid-rally. You see it happen quite a lot in world level Badminton. A player breaks a string or clashes with his partners‚Äô racquet making playing on near impossible. They‚Äôll have a racquet out ready by the side of the court for when this happens. They‚Äôll rush off mid-rally and try and get the new racquet so they can carry on and try to win the point.&lt;/p&gt;

I‚Äôve never travelled with my Badminton equipment by any others mean other than driving. International players have to take their equipment wherever they go. I can imagine being a little nervous ever letting your bag out of sight. Our equipment becomes very personal and we like to have it close at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, can a Badminton racquet be taken on a flight as hand luggage? &lt;strong&gt;Badminton racquets and bags cannot be taken on flights as hand luggage. They exceed the maximum size restrictions airlines have for hand luggage. Even a racquet on its own exceeds the maximum dimensions. Hand luggage needs to fit into the overhead storage in the plane‚Äôs cabin. This is the reason for the maximum size dimensions given by airlines.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can we do? We‚Äôre travelling by plane and need to take our Badminton equipment with us? What do other people do in this scenario? Read on to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why can‚Äôt I take it on as hand luggage?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All airlines have restrictions on cabin/hand luggage. Size restrictions as well as weight restrictions per passenger. These restrictions are in place for the safety of the aircraft in flight and so that each passenger gets an allocated space for their hand luggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size restriction is because all loose hand luggage must be stored in the overhead compartments provided during takeoff, landing and during turbulence. All the situations that could result in bags etc being thrown around the cabin and could injure someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weight restriction is in place so that the aircraft isn‚Äôt overburdened. Being overburdened can put the plane out of balance during flight. It can also result in the plane burning more fuel than anticipated for the trip and result in a diversion for a refuel or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skyscanner has an article that details the majority of the hand luggage restrictions for airlines &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skyscanner.net/news/cabin-luggage-guide-hand-baggage-sizes-and-weight-restrictions&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The airlines with the most generous maximum dimensions are British Airways, easyJet and Jet2. Their maximum dimensions are 56√ó45√ó25 centimetres (length, width and depth). Badminton racquets alone are between 66.5 to 67.5 centimetres long. BWF actually have a rule which means they cannot exceed 68 centimetres long. So even a racquet on its own is too long. If you carry your racquets in a racquet bag like most there‚Äôs no way you could take that on as hand luggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years airports and airlines have become increasingly cautious about what can be taken on board flights, especially in hand luggage. Anything that could be used as a weapon or generally be deemed as dangerous are strictly banned. I‚Äôve struggled to find details, other than size restrictions, on why sports racquets aren‚Äôt allowed. I would guess that they could be used as weapons in the wrong hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Checked baggage is best&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checked in luggage is your only option for transporting your Badminton equipment for flying. There are a lot fewer restrictions for checked in luggage although there are still some regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most airlines let you carry up to around 20 kilos of checked in luggage. You can even pay to be able to take more checked in but it can get expensive. Again Skyscanner has a great article covering the major airlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum size dimensions for checked in luggage varies a lot more than it does for hand luggage between airlines. Some airlines don‚Äôt have any size restrictions for checked in luggage. It‚Äôs worth checking which airlines have restrictions and measure up your Badminton bag just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might find it easier to fold up your normal Badminton bag, if possible, and store it in your normal travel suitcase. You can then pack your racquets in a more compact racquet carrier and have Badminton shoes, shuttles etc stored in a travel suitcase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to pack your racquets to avoid getting damaged&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, unfortunately, we have to let our precious Badminton belongings go at the check-in. So what can we do to make sure out racquets get through all the hustle and bustle that luggage experiences during its transport in one piece? Fortunately, there are some easy ways to ensure our equipment stays protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put your racquets back in their original cases.&lt;/strong&gt; All racquets bought new, and some used, come with either a racquet head cover or a full-length cover to protect the racquet from scratches and scrapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pack your racquet bag or sleeves with styrofoam peanuts or bubble wrap.&lt;/strong&gt; Even better, use both! If you don‚Äôt have the original racquet case the racquet normally comes with use bubble wrap to give each racquet some protection. The bubble wrap will help minimise scratches as well as cushion the racquet from any impact through transit. If you have a racquet bag then you could also fill the rest of the bag with styrofoam peanuts. These will fill out the remaining empty space helping to keep the racquets from sliding around too much and reduce impact damage. Both are relatively cheap to buy and you can get them on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lost or damaged luggage?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the statistics show that lost and damaged luggage is declining. SITA is a multinational IT company that services airlines. They have around 400 members and 2,800 customers around the world which is claimed to be 90% or the world‚Äôs airline business. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sita.aero/resources/type/surveys-reports/baggage-report-2018&quot;&gt;They reported&lt;/a&gt; that baggage mishandling has dropped more than 70% since 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what should you do if you‚Äôre the unlucky few to experience damages or lost luggage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Damaged luggage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most airlines have processes set out for filing a damage complaint normally called a PIR (Property Irregularity Report). This form must be filled out and submitted to the airline you flew with within 7 days although this length of time can vary. There are normally a number of exceptions for things you can‚Äôt claim for such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Superficial damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Damage due to overpacking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From weather damage such as rain or snow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fragile items being broken if packed in a container designed for shipping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A long list of excluded fragile items packed in luggage such as jewellery and electronics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No two airlines have the same policies when it comes to damaged luggage so it‚Äôs always best to check with your individual airline before flying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative to claiming directly through the airline most travel insurance covers damaged luggage. Insurance companies will be able to aid you in the process but it is the airline that is responsible for any reimbursement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid any mishaps with luggage and potential damage here are some simple tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don‚Äôt overpack for luggage, could lead to bursting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a suitcase with recessed wheels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a fabric suitcase over a plastic or hard suitcase. Plastic/hard suitcases can crack in cold weather or from being crushed by other luggage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy a cover to protect from scraping and zippers being caught&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lost luggage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process for reporting luggage lost is largely the same except you normally have 21 days to file the claim. Luggage is officially declared as lost after 21 days. You‚Äôll have to file a PIR in writing or online if the airline provides the ability to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensation won‚Äôt cover the entire contents of your luggage. One tip is to keep anything expensive or valuable in your carry on luggage if allowed. Compensation is normally limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bare essentials such as toiletries and clothing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partial cost or replacing lost luggage contents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs advisable to have photographic evidence of the contents of your luggage. So always take some photos as an inventory whilst packing. They often ask for receipts for any expensive items so try and keep e-receipts and photograph physical receipts. Airlines usually won‚Äôt pay out for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚ÄúNew for old‚Äù replacement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything valuable, fragile or perishable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stress or inconvenience caused&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making the claim&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have the PIR form whether your luggage is damaged or lost make sure to have all of this information available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flight details; dates, flight number etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether your luggage is damaged or lost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your total monetary claim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A full list of damaged or lost items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List of items you had to purchase because of lost items. Toiletries etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you‚Äôve submitted your claim make sure to be proactive on chasing the airline. They‚Äôll happily take their time to deal with your case if you don‚Äôt chase them. The results of them taking their time or being quick about it will roughly be the same in the end so don‚Äôt be too polite, chase them each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Related questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What items are not allowed in hand luggage?&lt;/strong&gt; Items such as sporting equipment, sharp objects, alcohol, flammable items etc are all banned for hand luggage. These items are pretty obvious but Skyscanner has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skyscanner.net/news/flights/airline-carry-on-restrictions-and-prohibited-items-on-board&quot;&gt;comprehensive guide&lt;/a&gt; on carry-on restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

In basketball and volleyball you see a lot of the best players are tall, commonly at least six feet tall. In other sports, it‚Äôs more desirable to be shorter and more compact like racing jockeys. So naturally, there must be traits that are desirable for Badminton?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So do you have to be tall to play Badminton? &lt;strong&gt;Simply put, no you don‚Äôt have to be tall to play Badminton. Anybody can play Badminton. That‚Äôs the beauty of the sport, it‚Äôs accessible to everyone. It can be an advantage in some scenarios which is a different question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve played with good players of all kinds. Tall and short, old and young. There isn‚Äôt one physical characteristic that makes a great Badminton player. But let‚Äôs look closer at how being tall can be an advantage and a disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How being tall can be an advantage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be an advantage in many areas of Badminton if you‚Äôre taller than the average person. These differ when playing singles, level doubles and mixed doubles. Each of the disciplines can be approached in a variety of ways to take advantage of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Longer arms, greater reach and leverage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body is all in proportion, so the taller you are the longer your arms and legs etc will be. Having longer arms gives you the ability to reach further without having to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taller singles players like Viktor Axelsen (1.94 meters tall) uses his height to great effect in men‚Äôs singles. You often when he‚Äôs defending that he only needs to take a small step, if any, and stretch out his racquet arm to be able to reach a smash. Same for playing most shots from the defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same applies for overhead shots. Being able to reach up higher he can strike the shuttle at a higher point even without jumping. Adding a jump as well and he can reach the shuttle at around 3 meters! This means he can achieve very steep angles on his attacking shots. Most players are unable to even reach the shuttle most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without jumping into a full-on science lesson there is another advantage in Badminton with longer arms. The way we hit the shuttle overhead in badminton is a bit like a trebuchet or a slingshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With both of these pieces of weaponry, they rely on the clever use of levers to be able to deliver projectiles. When hitting the shuttle overhead we swing the arm in a similar motion as trebuchet fires the load. Our forearm and upper arm work with the elbow to act as a lever. It‚Äôs noted in physics that with longer levers less effort is needed to move a greater load. So having longer arms has a similar effect with proper technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world. - Archimedes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just see this incredible smash by Mads Kolding of Denmark and you can see how everything builds up, but it‚Äôs the last pronation with the forearm that generates the speed of the racquet and hence more force into the shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;

          &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;h3&gt;Longer legs, bigger stride&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usain Bolt, the legendary sprinter is analysed as an anomaly in sprinting. Taller than what sports scientists would agree to be the ‚Äúideal‚Äù height of a sprinter he defies the odds. They all acknowledge his talent and hard work but also note his one big advantage. He‚Äôs not as fast out of the blocks as most sprinters but being taller gives him a longer stride. Once he gets into a full sprint each stride he takes is that much bigger than his opponents allowing him to cover more ground with fewer strides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same advantage applies to badminton but not in terms of speed. Longer legs mean longer strides so when we see Viktor Axelsen and Chen Long play you see they can cover a lot of the court with only a few steps from the centre. Couple this with good timing and reactions and they can cover the whole court with less movement than most players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to take longer and fewer steps is more efficient than having to take multiple shorter steps. Here‚Äôs a great example of Viktor Axelsen showing the ease he covers the court often reaching the shuttle with one lunge!&lt;/p&gt;

            height: 100%;
          &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;h2&gt;How being tall can be a disadvantage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not all positives, unfortunately. These natural advantages all come with counteracting disadvantages. Not that they can‚Äôt be overcome but without training these can often be exploited by seasoned opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Long arms, better out than in&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The counterpart disadvantage of having a better reach than most is that it makes it more awkward to protect the body area. You see the likes of Lee Chong Wei, Kento Momota and others using the body smash against players like Viktor Axelsen and Chen Long to great effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When players use the body smash they tend to aim for the other players‚Äô racquet side hip. Without shifting your defensive stance it can be near impossible to return an accurate body smash like this. You need to shift your body to be able to get your arm out of the way of the racquet to defend that area. Here‚Äôs a great compilation video of the body smash being used well.&lt;/p&gt;

          &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;h3&gt;Long legs, twist and turn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic lesson taught when first beginning Badminton is to get low in your ready position. You can‚Äôt be stood upright otherwise your centre of gravity will be too high making it difficult to move and change direction quickly. If you have longer legs you have to squat more to get your centre of gravity low enough to be agile enough to keep pace in a fast rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs another tactic used against taller players to keep them twisting and changing directions. It takes good leg strength to be able to stay low in your stance for an entire match. Another slight disadvantage is steep smashes become much harder to get back as well. You‚Äôll have to lunge a lot more in order to reach the shot without bending over which can damage your back and posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So how tall are the best players in the world?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elite in Badminton come in all shapes and sizes. There is no one body type that suits Badminton best. A lot of it comes down to tactics and how you play. But let‚Äôs have a look at the players at the extremes. How tall are the tallest and how short are the shortest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the tallest players in world Badminton are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mads Pieler Kolding (2.05 meters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vladimir Ivanov (2.01 meters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viktor Axelsen (1.94 meters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chen Long (1.87 meters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mads Conrad-Petersen (1.86 meters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shortest players in world Badminton are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nozomi Okuhara (1.56 meters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Akane Yamaguchi (1.56 meters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tai Tzu-Ying (1.63 meters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ashwini Ponnappa (1.65 meters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saina Nehwal (1.65 meters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see there is a large difference between the tallest and smallest. The biggest difference being 40 centimetres (nearly 16 inches). In each list, we have Olympic, World and All England champions aplenty. So being tall or short is not an overwhelming advantage or disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hard work trumps natural ability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Matthew Surf‚Äôs book Bounce, the author provides a lot of case studies and research that proves that practice overcomes ‚Äúnatural ability‚Äù. If you can master a skill or a sport than it won‚Äôt matter what natural advantages you or your opponents have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the example of Usain Bolt, his height comes with some natural disadvantages. Requiring more power to leave the blocks he overcomes this through rigorous training. He is able to have a start much faster then he would naturally by mitigating this disadvantage through practice. This then allows him to only gain more advantage as the race plays out to his natural strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the Badminton equivalent was the legendary men‚Äôs double player Jung Jae-Sung. In men‚Äôs doubles, it‚Äôs a clear advantage when receiving the serve and playing from the back if you‚Äôre taller. You can attack the shuttle on the return of serve very aggressively by reaching the net early. Trying to defend smashes from tall players can be so difficult with the steepness they can hit the shot. Jung Jae-Sung managed to overcome his lack of height with sheer hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were used to seeing him taking the role as the rear court player when playing with Lee Yong-Dae. Despite his lack of height, he was able to hit incredible smashes with both power and steepness. A powerful athlete he was able to jump so high to hit smashes that it didn‚Äôt matter that he measured only 1.68 meters tall. Here‚Äôs a quick video of his smash in slow motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Related questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does badminton increase height?&lt;/strong&gt; Scientists do agree that certain exercises combined with good nutrition can stimulate bone growth. Longer bones especially in the legs results in naturally becoming taller. It‚Äôs noted that this growth stimulus is most affective in a persons teenage years. After about 20 years of age both male and females growth stops. So you‚Äôre unlikely to see anymore growth after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How tall is Lin Dan?&lt;/strong&gt; Lin Dan measures in at 1.78 meters (5.8 feet) average height for a man these days.&lt;/p&gt;

Serving overhand in other racquet sports is normally legal. A good serve can be all the difference in racquet sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people picking up a racquet for the first time will naturally look to serve underarm in Badminton. It feels natural, the shuttlecock has to go over the net so it makes sense to serve underarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it begs to question, can you serve overhand in Badminton? &lt;strong&gt;Due to a rule change in 2018, there are two rule sets for Badminton provided by the BWF. The new and an alternative ruleset. The alternative ruleset doesn‚Äôt allow for overhand serving at all. With the new ruleset you technically can, it‚Äôs just not very advantageous or optimal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what‚Äôs in the rules of Badminton that disallows overhand serving? And what‚Äôs the difference between the new and alternative rulesets? Let‚Äôs have a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The rules for serving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules for serving in Badminton are detailed in the statutes provided by the BWF. For beginners, the rules can sound complicated but once you get playing they‚Äôre not difficult to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few rules around serving to provide a fair start for both server and receiver. Here we‚Äôll just talk about the ones that relate to the topic; why you can‚Äôt serve overhand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two rulesets now provided by the BWF that govern the laws of Badminton. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.bwfbadminton.com/statutes/#1513733461252-a16ae05d-1fc9&quot;&gt;current ruleset&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=&quot;https://corporate.bwfbadminton.com/statutes/#1513733461252-a16ae05d-1fc9&quot;&gt;alternative ruleset&lt;/a&gt;. This came about due to a change in the laws for serving made back in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bwfbadminton.com/news-single/2017/11/29/experimental-service-law-from-march-2018&quot;&gt;March 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule that changed was point 9.1.6.a which stated; ‚Äúthe whole shuttle shall be below the server‚Äôs waist at the instant of being hit by the server‚Äôs racket. The waist shall be considered to be an imaginary line round the body, level with the lowest part of the server‚Äôs bottom rib.‚Äù This is the first law that prevents you from serving overhand because the shuttlecock must be below your waist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second law that was omitted when the rule change was 9.1.6.b which stated; ‚Äúthe shaft and the racket head of the server‚Äôs racket at the instant of hitting the shuttle shall be pointing in a downward direction.‚Äù This rule eliminates the ability to serve overhand as your racquet has to be pointing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these rules are now apart of the alternative laws for Badminton. These rules override only the corresponding points from the main Laws of Badminton document and the rest of the ruleset still applies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new rule 9.1.6 states; ‚Äúthe whole shuttle shall be below 1.15 metres from the surface of the court at the instant of being hit by the server‚Äôs racket.‚Äù So now the rule is dubious because the height of 1.15 meters can be measured. The waist height of each person is different and caused a lot of controversy in matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A law that has not changed is 9.1.8 which states; ‚Äúthe flight of the shuttle shall be upwards from the server‚Äôs racket to pass over the net so that, if not intercepted, it shall land in the receiver‚Äôs service court (i.e. on or within the boundary lines)‚Äù So the fact that the shuttlecock has to travel upwards first is also another barrier to serving overhand. It‚Äôs pretty much impossible to serve overhand without infringing this rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why do these rules exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these rules combined are meant to provide a fair opportunity for server and receiver at the start of the rally. Without them, the server would always have the overwhelming advantage which would ruin the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, being unable to serve overarm eliminates players being able to just play a smash as their serve from the net which would be impossible to return. Combined with the law that states the shuttle has to travel upwards first means the server is in control of the shuttle but the receiver is in control of the responding shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the server serves well it should make the return difficult or at least controlled. And if the server serves poorly the receiver had a chance to take the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the late 1970s and early 1980s a pair of Malaysian brothers, Rashid and Misbun Sidek, developed a serve which would go on to be called the S-serve. They‚Äôve become famous in the world of Badminton for their achievements both on the court as players and off the court as coaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S-serve was developed by the two and was later banned by the BWF for providing an unfair advantage. The serve involved hitting the shuttlecock by the feathers instead of the cork. This would cause the shuttlecock to spin uncontrollably and behave erratically as it was coming over the net. This made it almost impossible to return. This lead to the BWF introducing the rule that states you must hit the base of the shuttlecock first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You can technically serve overhand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differentiation in rules for serving only exists for the elite level of Badminton. The alternative ruleset provides strict conditions that the servers racquet head and shaft must be discernibly pointing downwards. That alone makes serving overhand impossible. However, that rule is omitted in the new ruleset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that omission, it technically becomes possible to serve overhand as long as when you hit the shuttle below 1.15 meters from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs obvious why the rule had been omitted because to serve overhand you would have to sit or lie down. You could then play the shot overhead from there. Obviously, when you see it in practice it looks ridiculous and provides absolutely zero advantage as the shuttle still has to travel upwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So technically you can but I doubt anyone ever would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How are you meant to serve? The basic forehand and backhand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you can‚Äôt serve overhand in Badminton, how are you meant to serve? There are two types of serve commonly used in Badminton. These are the forehand and backhand serves. You can use either and you can serve short and long with both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have full articles on serving in general, forehand serve and backhand serve. But here is the basics of each serve summarised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Backhand short serve&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a backhand grip, hold the racquet with the head pointing down at an angle of around 30-45 degrees from horizontal. Hold the shuttlecock by the feather in the non-racquet hand at around waist height (for most people this will be below the 1.15 meters anyway) in front of the racquet. Execute the serve with a simple pullback of the racquet then forwards to hit the shuttle. That‚Äôs the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This serve is mainly used in doubles and has now become more popular in singles too. Read the full guide we have here which covers more like serving in doubles versus singles, where to stand and where to serve to etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Backhand flick serve&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup for this serve is the same as the backhand short serve. The only difference is where you serve to. You‚Äôre aiming to serve to the back service line for singles or doubles. To do this you simply have to drive the shuttle upwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim is to get the shuttlecock over and behind the opponent. This will make returning the shuttle more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Forehead short serve&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginners will be more familiar with the forehand serve. It‚Äôs often the natural thing people do by default to start play. Hold the racquet with a forehand grip and raise the racquet up facing upwards around shoulder height. In the non-racquet hand hold the shuttle up and out in front of you at around shoulder height as well. Then drop the shuttle and swing the racquet with an underarm swing, striking the shuttle at around waist height. Try and land the shuttle near the front service line. This will take practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the backhand serve there is more to this. The full article can be found here. Make sure to let the shuttle drop low and use the energy from falling to do most of the work when hitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Forehand high serve&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high forehand serve is the same setup as the short forehand serve. Except with this serve you‚Äôre aiming to hit the shuttle high and deep into the opponent‚Äôs service box. Do this by driving the shuttlecock up with a faster swing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tip with this serve, it‚Äôs easier to get good length by holding the shuttlecock nice and high and letting it drop more to get more momentum when you hit the shuttle. This serve is only seen in singles these days and mainly in women‚Äôs singles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Related questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the types of service in Badminton?&lt;/strong&gt; There are two ways of serving in Badminton. Forehand and backhand. With these two you can then serve short to the net or serve long to the back service line (the line differs for singles and doubles)&lt;/p&gt;

I used to play with a kids set that had plastic shuttles, simple racquets and a popup net. I used to with my brother and sister in the summertime. Looking back now it‚Äôs not really the Badminton we know and love is it? But it does bring up an interesting question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can Badminton be played outdoors? &lt;strong&gt;Badminton can be played indoors and outdoors for leisure and fun. However, it‚Äôs not possible to play competitive Badminton outside due to a few factors. The shuttlecock is a light projectile so playing outside with any wind will become impossible. Any weather but a dry slightly overcast day will be a problem as well, for visibility of the suttle if it‚Äôs too bright and for ruined shuttles and slippy courts if it‚Äôs raining.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been mentioned by the BWF (Badminton World Federation) that they were looking at an official outdoor/beach format of the sport. So what are the main challenges of providing an official outdoor format of the sport and how might they be overcome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playing Badminton outdoors, the problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We briefly touched on the problems with playing Badminton outside. Let‚Äôs explore all the issues that we face in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The shuttlecock through wind and rain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem we have is the shuttlecock. The shuttlecock is unique in the world of sport. Other racquets sports all have balls as the object of play. A shuttlecock is made with 16 feathers from the left wing of a goose. Attached to a cork base and tied with string the total weight of a shuttlecock is around 5 grams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Tennis ball in comparison weighs around 60 grams. Twelve times heavier than a shuttlecock. Even a Golf ball is heavier weighing roughly 50 grams. The weight of the shuttlecock is a problem because it can be disrupted by the wind. Playing outside and blowing away in the wind means you‚Äôd rarely be able to control any of your shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs an extreme and extremely funny example of the shuttlecock and wind.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div
            class=&quot;gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper&quot;
            style=&quot;padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem&quot;
          &gt;
            &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AD0dID7T4f8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen style=&quot;
            position: absolute;
            top: 0;
            left: 0;
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
          &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;p&gt;As well as the weight of the shuttlecock being a problem the shape of a shuttlecock is a problem as well. Shuttlecocks are designed to decelerate after being hit. Their cone shape acts like a parachute, slowing the shuttles decent. The aerodynamics of a shuttlecock is designed to travel in a singular direction. Unlike balls which are spherical and can spin and roll and have equal air drag on all sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing outside on a rainy day can be trouble for a few reasons. One is that the shuttlecock will become waterlogged as the feathers will capture the rain. This will weight the shuttle down more and change the aerodynamics of the shuttlecock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Playing visibility and safety&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the majority of a Badminton game, the shuttlecock is above head height. Meaning most of the time you or the other players are looking up constantly. It‚Äôs noted that certain halls and sports centres are not suited for Badminton because the lights are placed in bad spots. The shuttlecock can get ‚Äúlost in the lights‚Äù and makes it impossible to see when hitting the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same problem playing outside. If it‚Äôs a very sunny day, or the sun is low in the sky, then players could find themselves blinded by the sun constantly. Badminton needs strong well-placed lighting for an optimal playing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mentioned rainy days bein problematic for shuttlecocks. That‚Äôs not the only problem rainy days will cause. Having a wet or damp playing surface is very dangerous. You see the courts being mopped all the time in international Badminton. The combination of fast play and lots of turning, jumping and twisting players need good footing to save themselves from falling. Any wetness on the ground can cause players to slip and that‚Äôs how injuries happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outdoor/beach format? Crossminton!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BWF &lt;a href=&quot;https://bwfbadminton.com/news-single/2016/07/14/bwf-to-explore-outdoor-and-online-options/&quot;&gt;noted in 2016&lt;/a&gt; that they were looking at official formats for competitive outdoor Badminton. Eager to modernize Badminton and join the growing popularity of outdoor and beach sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2016 there hasn‚Äôt been any further mention of the outdoor/beach format at all. However, an alternative has existed since 2000 and it‚Äôs called Crossminton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded by Bill Branded and others who wanted a wind stable version of Badminton. They created the prototypes for equipment to be able to play indoors and outdoors on various surfaces without the need of a net either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of developing as a sport, the ISBO (International Speed Badminton Organisation)  was formed in 2011 to formally organise the sport. This would later be changed to ICO (International Crossminton Organisation) with the name change of the sport in 2016 to be called Crossminton once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossminton is more of a mixture of Badminton, Tennis and Squash. The closest relation to Badminton that Crossminton has is the speeder which is the outdoor equivalent of a shuttlecock. There is no net in Crossminton and instead, the two sides of the court are separated by 40 feet of empty space. The aim is to land the speeder in the opponent‚Äôs court or for the opponent to be unable to return or miss the court, much like Badminton. There are other differences but see our full article covering the sport here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three changes that Crossminton has that allows for outdoor play is the speeder, the court and the removal of the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speeder is designed to be wind-stable. Being heavier than a feather shuttlecock and made from synthetic materials they last a lot longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court set up is different, the two sides of the court are separated by empty space (the length varies for age groups etc) and the box each player plays in is 5.5 meters wide and long. This is narrower and shorter than one side of a badminton court. This makes covering the court easier especially if played on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The removal of the net is also a big help for playing outside because the approach to the game is different. Instead of having a lot of high lifts Crossminton is played more direct by players aiming to hit each other‚Äôs boxes. This provides less chance for the speeder to get carried away with the wind and for players to be blindsided by the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Still want to practice Badminton outside though?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a fan of Crossminton? Or really want to stick to traditional Badminton whilst outside? Here are a couple of simple practices you can do even outside to get your fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The classic wall practice.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a great practice regardless of doing it indoors or outdoors. It improves your wrist power and reactions. It‚Äôs even better playing against a brick wall that‚Äôs uneven with gaps etc as the shuttlecock will come back in unexpected ways making it fun. The wind won‚Äôt get in the way of this one too much as the shuttle won‚Äôt be up in the air for long enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This man provides a great example of the practice and some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/467332073676691/videos/404575113647138/&quot;&gt;nice trick shots!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flat driving practice.&lt;/strong&gt; A tennis court is a good one for this. You and one other person stand on the wide singles line on the same side of the net and face each other. The aim of the practice is to try and drive the shuttle past the other one without moving off the line. You‚Äôll have to drive it quite hard for the shuttle to travel the distance and even harder to beat the other person. For the same reasons, this can be suitable for outdoors with minimal wind because the shuttle is not high in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Related questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Badminton indoor or outdoor game?&lt;/strong&gt; Competitive Badminton is purely an indoor sport. The shuttlecock being affected by wind and rain water-logging shuttlecocks ruins flight trajectory. Rain would make the playing surface slippy and dangerous for all the twisting and jumping involved in Badminton. Badminton is played outside purely for leisure and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I play Badminton in windy conditions?&lt;/strong&gt; Playing Badminton outside in windy conditions can be near impossible. The only way to play is to keep it casual and not be too serious otherwise injuries are bound to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

Football stadiums can host rugby matches and netball matches can be played at basketball venues. These are just two examples of how sports venues can be multi-use. People know there are differences between all of these sports and that just because they can be played at the same venue doesn‚Äôt mean the court or field setup is the same. They‚Äôre not the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the question is; are Badminton and Tennis courts the same? &lt;strong&gt;Badminton and Tennis courts are not the same and there are many differences between the two. Badminton courts are much smaller than Tennis courts. Badminton courts are only designed to be indoors although the BWF has looked at outdoor badminton as a viable addition to the sport in recent years. Badminton court regulations only allow for one surface type whereas Tennis has other three different surface types which are clay, grass, carpet and hardcourt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the differences between Badminton and Tennis courts are more nuanced that not many people are aware of. Some of these differences are for important to avoid injuries to players of the sport and some are preferences of each sport. Let‚Äôs have a look in more detail the differences between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The court sizes for Badminton and Tennis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest difference between a Badminton court and a Tennis court is the size, the dimensions of the court. A Tennis court is much bigger than a Badminton court. In fact, a Tennis court is almost 1.5x larger than a Badminton court. BWF (Badminton World Federation) set regulations for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://extranet.bwfbadminton.com/docs/document-system/81/1466/1470/SECTION%204.1-%20Laws%20of%20Badminton.pdf&quot;&gt;size of Badminton courts&lt;/a&gt; which must be 6.1 meters wide (20 feet) for doubles and 5.18 meters (17 feet) for singles. The length of the court should be 13.4 meters (44 feet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas ITF (International Tennis Federation) state that a Tennis court should be 36 feet (10.97 meters) wide for doubles and 8.23 meters (27 feet) wide for singles. The length of the court should be 23.77 meters (78 feet) long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs worth noting that these are just the court surface sizes. Both international bodies also outline having more space around the court available as a minimum for play. This is especially important in Tennis where the players, mainly singles players, spend more time outside of the court marking then they do inside. Badminton players can also find themselves outside the court lines but is very rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Court surfaces, Tennis has four and Badminton has one?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned earlier, Tennis has four different court surfaces approved by the ITF which are clay, grass, carpet and hardcourt. These reflect Tennis‚Äô origins as being an outdoor sport. Clay, grass and hardcourt are all surfaces used in outdoor Tennis at all levels of play. Carpet is used for indoors and hardcourt can be also but you never see carpet surface being used at a professional level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these surfaces support the way Tennis is played. You need enough grip underfoot to be able to stop and change direction but not too much that you‚Äôre unable to slide when needed. You do a lot more running longer distances in Tennis then you do Badminton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badminton however only has one approved court surface which is a wooden sprung floor covered with an approved playing mat that is normally made of PVC or other synthetic material. At lower level international tournaments, BWF accepts fully synthetic courts or wooden court surfaces, either permanent or portable, as long as they meet their set standards. Their standards document can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://system.bwfbadminton.com/documents/folder_1_81/folder_1_140/folder_1_165/Flooring%20Overview.pdf&quot;&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do see however at club level and even county/regional Badminton that other court surfaces are more various. This comes from the lack of Badminton specific venues in most countries or lack of supplies for portable mats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why the fuss over specific flooring?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulations for both sports is not without reason. Tennis requires a lot of running so you need a good court surface to be able to stop and start running. Badminton requires you to move faster over shorter differences so you need more grip to be able to stop and start moving. Badminton also has you twisting and turning more because you not only have to deal with moving side to side but also moving forwards and backwards on the court. Having poor grip makes twisted knees and ankles and slips inevitable which is unacceptable at any level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Badminton it also very important to have a impact reducing flooring for the court. As well as moving around the court with speed there is a lot of jumping and general agility in Badminton to deal with. Knee injuries are unavoidable without a good court to play on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four main flooring systems used in sports. These are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point elastic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixed elastic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Area elastic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combined elastic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These four systems have set characteristics and are designed with either particular sports or general use in mind. Out of the four systems, only one is not suitable for Badminton which is the point elastic system. This system is normally a synthetic flooring material (usually a wet poured polyurethane) to cover an existing surface such as concrete. The point elastic systems create a more uniform playing surface and create some impact reduction for players but because it is only a top layer the are of displacement when the impact happens is only very small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed elastic flooring systems consist of a point elastic top layer with a synthetic area-stiffening agent used beneath on top of the base floor. This creates a wider area of displacement of force that point elastic systems have when used alone making it a better surface for Badminton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Area elastic flooring systems are quite different in that they have a raised top layer above the subfloor. The top layer flooring sits in a framework of beams that create hollow parts in the flooring that allow the top layer to deform into. This system gives the best area of displacement for force upon impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last system, combined elastic, is probably considered the best for badminton as it provides all the benefits of both point elastic and area elastic. The system consists of an area elastic design that has a top coating of a point elastic system meaning it has the impact reduction qualities and also the endurance qualities of a point elastic system for sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badminton should never be played on hard surfaces such as concrete, tarmac etc because of the risk of injury. For professional level Badminton the BWF review all venues where Badminton is being hosted so that they meet their strict standards and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Indoor vs outdoor Badminton and Tennis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem obvious but a big difference between the courts for Badminton and those for Tennis is that Badminton has no regulations for outdoor courts because the sport is always played inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tennis originated as an outdoor lawn sport and has been adapted to be played in indoor arenas. Badminton, on the other hand, has never had a outdoor counterpart for courts because the sport becomes impractical when played outside. A shuttlecock weighs 4-6 grams which is nothing compared to a Tennis ball weighin around 60 grams. Playing Badminton outside with a shuttlecock becomes impossible if it‚Äôs windy or raining or anything else besides sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Related questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are Badminton and Tennis the same?&lt;/strong&gt; Badminton and Tennis are both racquet sports but are completely different sports. Tennis is played with a soft nylon or cotton covered rubberised ball and Badminton is played with a shuttlecock. There are other differences such as the racquets being different, the rules and way they‚Äôre played etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What‚Äôs the difference Badminton and Tennis shoes?&lt;/strong&gt; Tennis shoes have thicker padding on the heels of the shoe because of the amount of running done. They also don‚Äôt have non-marking gum soles on the bottom of the shoes which are designed for indoor sports. These two differences mean they‚Äôre not well suited for Badminton where you need more grip and more manoeuvrability for the foot.&lt;/p&gt;

I turned up for practice one night and saw something I‚Äôve never seen since. Someone had turned up early and set up the nets ready for people to play when they got there. But this person used Volleyball nets mistakenly with the Badminton posts instead of the actual Badminton nets. The results were strange, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So are Badminton and Volleyball nets the same? &lt;strong&gt;The simple answer is no, Badminton and Volleyball nets are very different. Volleyball courts are much wider and longer than a Badminton court so the net is much longer. The holes in a Volleyball net are also a lot bigger, Badminton nets being much smaller to stop the shuttle passing through. Volleyball nets attach to their posts in a different way then a Badminton net does.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the Badminton courts setup with Volleyball nets was a mess and I can‚Äôt believe the person didn‚Äôt stop to think something wasn‚Äôt quite right, made me laugh a little at least. Mentioning some of the differences between the different nets lets look into these differences in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The big differences between Badminton and Volleyball nets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you lay down both a Volleyball net and a Badminton net next to each other the differences become more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volleyball nets have much bigger holes in them as they only need to stop a volleyball which is quite big. Bigger spacing in netting also means it‚Äôs easier to see what‚Äôs happening on the other side of the court for players. Badminton nets have much smaller holes as they need to be able to stop the shuttle passing through. For the same reason, the holes are not too small so that players can see the shuttle and the opponent on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both nets Volleyball and Badminton nets have a thick cord running along the top of the net covered by tape. For Badminton this is to stop the shuttle passing over the net every time without resistance. If there were no thick cord the shuttle will most likely pass over the net the majority of the time in erratic ways creating an element of luck for those who could exploit it. For Volleyball the cord serves the same purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference is that a Volleyball net has the tape run around all sides of the net and there is also another thick cord that runs along the bottom of the net so the net can be tightened at the top and bottom. For Badminton the net only needs to be held tight at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Volleyball net can be set up at various height depending on who is playing whether it be men, women or younger children or teenagers. Badminton nets are only even set up at on regulated set height, it doesn‚Äôt vary for any reason not even for Para-Badminton players. Due to this difference Volleyball nets normally have a lot of extra cord so that it can reach the tying points at varying heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the biggest difference of all is the length of the net. Volleyball nets are roughly 32 feet/9.75 meters long whereas Badminton nets are only 20 feet/6 meters long. So there is absolutely no way you could set up a Volleyball court with a Badminton net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Badminton net regulations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BWF (Badminton World Federation) and the FIVB (F√©d√©ration Internationale de Volleyball) are the two governing bodies that maintain and create new laws for both sports. They both made changes to the rules over the years but normally much doesn‚Äôt change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the laws for the rules of the sport, there are laws about the regulation of equipment. This is to keep the sport as fair and as consistent as possible not matter where you play it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full specifications and restrictions for Badminton equipment can be found in the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://extranet.bwfbadminton.com/docs/document-system/81/1466/1470/SECTION%204.1-%20Laws%20of%20Badminton.pdf&quot;&gt;BWF Laws of Badminton guide&lt;/a&gt;. It stated that posts shall be 1.55 meters tall from the courts surface and must be able to stand still when the net is ‚Äústrained‚Äù. This could be either from tightening up the net ties or from the shuttle hitting the net etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posts shall always be placed on the doubles side line regardless of singles or doubles being played. The net mesh should be made from fine cord and a dark colour. The mesh should be between 15mm and 20mm for each empty space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net itself should be 76cm from tape to the bottom of the net and should be at least 6.1m wide to cover the width of the court. The top of the net should be set with white tape 75mm doubled over thick cord running the length of the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net should be tightly set and flush with the top of the posts. It is mentioned that the net can dip a little in the centre as it can never be perfectly taut. 1.524 meters at the centre of the net is the acceptable height. The last part mentioned is that there should be no gap between the net and the post. Any gap should be closed by tying the cords on the bottom of the net to the post as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Casual multi-sport equipment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are products out there that are designed for multi-sport use but they‚Äôre for casual play, mainly for outdoors. So you can buy a popup net from somewhere like Amazon that you could use outside in the garden for a casual knock up with family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because we like to play to improve and get better at the sport doesn‚Äôt mean these can‚Äôt exist for those who just want to have some friendly family fun. If it also gets people talking about the sport more the more the merrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Related questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are Badminton and Volleyball posts the same?&lt;/strong&gt; No, Volleyball net posts are much taller for the taller net height. The way a Volleyball net is tied to it‚Äôs posts is different as well. Volleyball nets are more complicated to set up because the net has to be pulled tight there are normally cranks on the side to tighten and hold the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Badminton net made out of?&lt;/strong&gt; Badminton nets are normally made out of nylon but have been made out of vinyl and polyethylene before that. Even the tape that runs along the top of the net is made from nylon.&lt;/p&gt;

Elite level players are capable of defending smashes of over 350kmph. They‚Äôre capable of picking up deceptive shots when wrong-footed. They‚Äôre capable of incredible feats of speed and agility! The best elite players are able to keep up with the pace of the game thanks to stupidly fast reaction times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you improve your reaction time in Badminton? &lt;strong&gt;Reaction time can be improved with deliberate training and practice. Using a combination of training your eyes to see and process things faster, training your muscles to react to those stimuli at quicker rates and training your brain to make choices more instinctively you can improve your reaction time for badminton. Some useful exercises include juggling and ball drills, playing reaction test games and doing regular badminton drills at nearly double speed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs important to work on improving your reactions if you want to get better. It‚Äôs not often talked about in relation to improving yourself in the sport. Read on for more details on how to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tests and exercises to improve your reaction time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can you do to improve your overall reaction speed? There are lots of easy practices you can do either solo or with a partner and some can even be done at home!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can break these exercises down into three different categories. Exercises to improve how fast our eyes respond to stimuli, exercises to improve our muscles response and then exercises that combine the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Eye exercises&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Juggling balls&lt;/strong&gt; - A great exercise for hand-eye coordination. Juggling three or more balls requires good coordination and improves your spatial awareness. Knowing where each ball is in the air or in your hand and continuing the juggle trains your eyes by tracking multiple objects and switching between them. This can be learnt at home at any time and as a plus is always a good party trick!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise catch&lt;/strong&gt; - This exercise does require another person and the game is simple. The other person needs to hold two objects (make sure they‚Äôre not fragile), one in each hand. The other person then needs to stand in front of you at arms length and drop one of the objects and you need to catch it. Which item they drop and when should be random so you can‚Äôt guess which one they will drop. Your eyes will need to see the object and process it and then coordinate to catch the object. Simple but effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing first-person shooter video games&lt;/strong&gt; - This one might surprise you. Studies prove that playing first-person shooter games moderately can improve your hand-eye coordination and general reaction time. Keeping track of everything going on in the game trains your brain to react to stimuli on screen with greater speed and accuracy. So now you have a good reason to pick up a controller and not feel guilty about it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Muscular response exercises&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plyometric training&lt;/strong&gt; - These are normally bodyweight exercises and they‚Äôre exercises that require maximum muscle exertion. These exercises help improve your explosive strength and power so naturally, this improves how fast you can move out of the blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agility drills&lt;/strong&gt; - Training using ladders drills, bleep tests or footwork drills all help towards building speed and agility. All of these will help make you quicker and lighter on your feet improving your acceleration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprinting&lt;/strong&gt; - Sprinters have incredible reactions and speed. Especially 100m sprinters where every millisecond counts in the race. These guys train to be the fastest they can be out of the blocks to get the best start possible. So sprinting not only improves your muscle response time but also makes you faster once moving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Combination exercises&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directed shuttle runs&lt;/strong&gt; - Shuttle runs are where you set a stack of shuttles in six areas of the court. Two shuttles at the front of the court on either side (either in on along the tramlines). Two in the middle and two at the back of the court in the same way. Then starting from the middle you run or chasse to one of the placed shuttles and touch it before returning to the middle again as fast as you can. This is great on its own for building speed but we can also train our reactions with the help of another person. The other person‚Äôs job is to point to the shuttle for you to move to next but they only point as you get back to the centre. This requires concentration and good reactions to keep moving quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Double time training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I like to call it but the basic concept is doing your regular multi-feed shuttle practices but doing them at nearly twice the speed you would normally. So if you‚Äôre doing a multi-feed that requires you to play smashes and nets or lifts and clears the feeder for the exercise needs to hit the next shuttle as your finishing your stroke and before you‚Äôve recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to call this ‚Äúdouble time training‚Äù as essentially your practising at nearly twice the speed you would actually experience in a game which is incredibly fast. This works better with multi-feeds where you don‚Äôt need to cover a large distance. A good example is multi-feed playing smashes from the back as if you‚Äôre the rear court player in doubles. You don‚Äôt need to cover all of the court, just the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So practising at a higher than normal feed shouldn‚Äôt affect your form too much and induce bad habits but will push you enough to improve both speed and reactions. This can be done with full-court exercises but requires good stamina and good footwork to be able to cover shots with minimal recovery time without being a totally sloppy practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not having time to recover forces you to react to the next shuttle faster and move quickly to each shot. Doing this type of training will make playing a match or doing normal practices feel that much easier as you will get used to a much higher intensity and speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where reaction speed is important in badminton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaction time is important for pretty much every aspect in badminton. From defending a smash to getting that really tight net kill. Badminton is a game of small margins which means every millisecond counts. If you find yourself constantly chasing the rally and not being able to get ahead, reactions could make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elite players of the world all have incredibly fast reactions. They‚Äôve trained themselves to the point where their responses are instinctive. In certain scenarios, they react in practised responses so they become more consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed of the rallies at which elite players play is so fast they can‚Äôt afford to be behind during any phase of the rally. Any delay and they‚Äôll find themselves more and more under pressure. A  lot of players adapt to this with a combination of fast reactions and anticipation, both combined make the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The science behind reaction time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know how important reactions are to the sport. Let‚Äôs have a look at the science behind this. Reactions are controlled by our nervous system. The central nervous system consists of the spinal cord and the brain. In our example for Badminton, we have visual cues from the shuttle being sent in a particular direction. Our eyes see the shuttle and our visual sensories send an electrical impulse through the nervous system to the brain and then we react!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactions are different to reflexes and they are often confused for being the same thing. Reflexes come from our evolution and they tend to protect us from things or situations that could do us harm. They‚Äôre normally triggered by what they call the negative feedback loop meaning they‚Äôre triggered in dangerous situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example is putting your hands out in front of you when you fall to stop your head hitting the floor. Reflexes happen much faster as they bypass the spinal cord and happen involuntarily and often can‚Äôt be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this difference established we now understand how our reactions work. We understand that reaction speed is a combination of how fast your eyes see the shuttle, process that and choose the correct response. This means how fast our muscles can react is important as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Related questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the average person‚Äôs reaction time?&lt;/strong&gt; According to various sources, the average person‚Äôs reaction time to visual stimuli is roughly between 250-300 milliseconds. This can be improved and elite athletes that rely on visual reaction time can get closer to 200 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can affect your reaction time?&lt;/strong&gt; There are various factors that can affect your reaction time. Some include things you can‚Äôt change such as your age, gender and personality type. Other factors that you can change such as physical fitness, fatigue levels, concentration and alcohol level.&lt;/p&gt;

The Secret to Speed in Badminton]]></title><description><![CDATA[Everyone I‚Äôve ever met in badminton always asks the question; ‚Äúhow can I get faster‚Äù or ‚Äúhow can I go faster to the shuttle‚Äù and I really‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://www.badmintonsbest.com/blog/the-split-step/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.badmintonsbest.com/blog/the-split-step/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Everyone I‚Äôve ever met in badminton always asks the question; ‚Äúhow can I get faster‚Äù or ‚Äúhow can I go faster to the shuttle‚Äù and I really believe that one of the keys to great speed in badminton is practising footwork. A lot of coaches go over the various movements that get you to the shuttle in a certain way, either by moving backwards, forwards or sideways, slow and fast movements etc. One of the key technique which isn‚Äôt given enough focus is the split step. So what is it and how can it help to learn this technique?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The badminton split step, also known as the split drop, is the technique of widening your stance to get ready for the next shot from the opponent. It‚Äôs a short, sharp and precise movement that widens your stance and gets your centre of gravity lower. Doing the split step allows you to change direction easier and get continuous fluid footwork. It‚Äôs an essential piece of footwork so let‚Äôs look into this vital technique in more detail.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to stand and when to use it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coaches teach the split step in various ways but the majority if not all agree that the split step is a lowering of your natural stance. Standing with your legs shoulder width apart and slightly bent you then want to jump slightly off the ground, no more than an inch or so, so both of your feet leave the ground and then land with your knees bent and your legs further apart just enough so that you can bounce off in any direction straight away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to load the legs and knees with kinetic energy from the slight jump and landing so that you spring back and are able to push off from the ground in the direction you need to move next. Don‚Äôt go too deep with the split or you‚Äôll find it difficult to push off quickly but widen and lower your stance enough so that you get the push in the legs, you can‚Äôt push off if your legs are already straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You use the split step every time the opponent is about to hit a shot. Using the split step allows you to time your footwork to the shot of the opponent so you can move quickly to wherever they place the shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important thing to note is that the split isn‚Äôt exactly the same all the time. There are times when the position and the way you split is slightly different. If the opponent is attacking you then you are on the defensive and most of the time you‚Äôre worried about covering the width of the court. You‚Äôll want to stand to face the net with your legs aligned to the left and right of the court. This keeps your legs in line with the direction you‚Äôre most likely going to be needing to move towards which is sideways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your attacking and the opponent is about to lift the shuttle from the net then you‚Äôll still want to do the split step but you‚Äôll want to have your legs one in front of you and one behind you because you‚Äôre more likely going to need to move either forwards or backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people make the mistake that the split step is only for when you‚Äôre defending but the truth is that you need to do it for every shot to keep your timing. The opponent can still deceive you when playing from a defensive position so don‚Äôt fall into this common pitfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It‚Äôs all about the timing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about timing the split this often matters more than getting the split right itself. If you have a good split, you get low in your stance and push off with good force but aren‚Äôt able to time it to your opponents next shot you‚Äôll find yourself getting stuck stood still or reacting too late to get reach the next shot effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of the split is crucial and is probably the hardest thing to get right. You want to time your split just as your opponent is hitting the shot and finishing the split just after they‚Äôve hit the shot. Splitting too soon and you‚Äôll have to pause ever so slightly to see where the shuttle is going next before you can move. Split too late and you‚Äôll find yourself rushing your footwork or not being able to reach the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finishing the split just after the opponent has played the shot allows you to push out of the split to where you need to go as your eyes have seen where the shuttle is going. It needs to be explosive and you need to push up from the floor straight away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does this make me faster?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that this technique will make you slower, if you only start moving after they‚Äôve hit the shot then you‚Äôre going to be slower getting there, correct? This is what I often hear but people forget that badminton is a game of &lt;strong&gt;speed and deception&lt;/strong&gt;. If you try and time your split as the opponent hits the shuttle you are more likely to be deceived as you have no time to be able to see where the shuttle is going next before you need to move off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The split step is the key to joining up all the other pieces of footwork on the court. It‚Äôs how the best make it look so easy as they glide around the court from shot to shot with barely a break in step. If you can master the split step then you can get into a good rhythm of footwork. You‚Äôll stop feeling like you‚Äôre chasing the shuttle all the time and start to feel like you‚Äôre able to start to take charge of the rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Training and exercises to increase speed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training the quick twitch fibre muscles in the legs and in the core will all help in a better split step. You should focus on exercises with explosive movement as you only need to use the power in the legs for a brief period for the split step you want the power to push off with great speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some free and easy ways to increase power in the legs and core to improve the split step are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burpees, a great all-around exercise that every athlete should have in their training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jumping/knee highs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squats, pistol squats and jumping squats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lunges and jumping split lunges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climbers and mountain climbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just a few you should try that require no equipment and can be fit into any training schedule. Some exercises that require equipment are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romanian deadlifts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barbell squats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lunges holding dumbells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Box jumps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean and presses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medicine ball throws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a routine out of these exercises will improve the power in your legs to be able to push off quicker and take a bigger first step after the split to get a good head start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Watch the best and see for yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always recommend watching the best f the best for anything but the top three players I would watch for good footwork you should try and mimic are Lee Chong Wei, Nozomi Okuhara and Lin Dan. No two players are exactly alike, we all do the same things slightly differently, it‚Äôs impossible to be exactly like any of these players or anyone else. The important thing to note is what the best share in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee Chong Wei has beautiful footwork and he flows from one shot to the next with ease and seems to float around the court. He‚Äôs also able to inject pace very suddenly and has very explosive movement when he needs to take advantage in the rally. Nozomi Okuhara is one of the fastest players I have ever seen on the court, if not arguably &lt;strong&gt;the fastest!&lt;/strong&gt; Despite her short stature, she covers the court and then some! She rarely lets off the pace and is most often the one taking charge of the rallies. Lin Dan used to be much like Lee Chong Wei but as he has gotten older has adapted his game to rely more on his amazing shot quality and variation. His footwork is less explosive and speedy now compared to his earlier days but what he lacks in pace he makes up for in efficiency and anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you watch all three players you‚Äôll see that they all share similar traits in their footwork but most noticeably is their split step. This is the key to being able to lead the rally and always be looking to take the next opportunity. They get out of the blocks quickly and are able to cover the court efficiently and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this information will serve you well, the split step is one thing I‚Äôm still working on as a player even after all these years and everything always has room for improvement. Learn the split step, it‚Äôs a fundamental technique in Badminton and practice, practice, practice till it becomes second nature.&lt;/p&gt;

I thought about that and actually, I‚Äôve always been taught to do a full dynamic warm-up properly before getting onto court and to do a cooldown afterwards. All the coaches I‚Äôve ever been too always instructed and insisted on that for the simple fact that it‚Äôs necessary to decrease the risk of picking up an injury. So how do you warm-up properly and cooldown properly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The simple answer is that you need to do a full body warm-up that uses dynamic stretching exercises and should probably take around 5-10 minutes before playing and then a full body cooldown that uses static stretching and should last roughly the same amount of time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that we know what we need to do let‚Äôs look at why we need to warm-up and cooldown properly and some good routines on what to do for each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why warm-up and cooldown?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warming up and cooling down are both things the majority of people know they should do for exercises like lifting weights and general gym/fitness training, why then do people not take this same approach before playing badminton?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bodies are made to move, everything about the human body lends itself to being very good at manoeuvring through space in a variety of ways. We do however live more stationary lives these days, we sit at our school or work desks and can be still for hours at a time. With all this sitting and being stationary our muscles become stiff which becomes a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our muscles are elastic, they relax and contract to push and pull to allow movement. Much like an elastic band when our muscles are cold from being stationary for too long they become stiff and therefore don‚Äôt stretch easily to allow for movement. We need to warm them up slowly until they are able to stretch and contract with ease. You‚Äôre more likely to pick up injuries from the lack of a quality warm-up. Cold muscles when stretched are more likely to tear and rip from being too stiff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of people will go on for a quick ‚Äúknock-up‚Äù as a way of warming themselves up to get ready to play. The problem is that they start with playing clears to each other which requires quite explosive movements for the upper body, this is not a gradual warm-up and also doesn‚Äôt aid in stretching all the muscle groups in the body ready for play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you‚Äôre done playing is always best to do a cooldown, like the warm-up this is something the majority of people rarely do but should. Doing a cooling down routine of 5-10 minutes helps get your body back to your natural resting point more gradually. It gradually reduces your heart and breathing rates, cools your body temperature, let‚Äôs your muscles return to their natural resting tension and length and helps prevent soreness in the muscles in the days to follow and improve the flexibility of the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The dynamic warm-up routine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are countless routines and ways to do warm-ups but what they all have in common is that they involve dynamic stretching. Dynamic stretching is warming and stretching your muscles whilst in motion, not standing on the spot, examples of dynamic stretches include various lunges, legs swings, squats, jumps etc. This is so that we can stretch the muscles to loosen up and the motion will get our heart pumping and start getting us warm, static stretching will stretch the muscles but won‚Äôt give you the body warm-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some typical warm-up routines I try and do each time before I play or train and are great for badminton in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warm up one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50 jumping jacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 lunges with a twist (five for each leg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 Cobras&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20 hand and knees arms stretches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 halasanas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50 high knees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 squat jumps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use this one a lot, it doesn‚Äôt seem like much but it‚Äôs a nice quick warm-up that hits all the major muscle groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warm up two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 minutes regular skipping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 minutes running skipping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 minutes fast running skipping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 burpees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 squats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 burpees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 squats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one takes a little longer but definitely gets the heart pumping and if you can skip well you should have a decent sweat on by the end of this. Burpees are not only a great exercise for training but can be used in a warm-up as long as you‚Äôre already warmed up to a degree which is why they come after the skipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve mentioned previously why we should warm-up but here I wanted to highlight the benefits of a good warm-up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved performance during workout and training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepares your heart for increased activity slowly, avoiding a sudden shock and increase in blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improves your coordination and muscles reaction timing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepares you mentally for the workout or training from the start&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best advice I ever had for warm-ups is that you should have ‚Äúlittle beads of sweat‚Äù, this means you‚Äôve done enough to get yourself really warmed through and ready to go from the off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The static cooldown routine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of cooling down is to slow your body‚Äôs processes down gradually rather than an abrupt stop followed by a lot of panting. When cooling down we use a combination of low-intensity activity such as walking or slow jogging and static stretching to reduce the soreness and stiffness often felt the next couple of days after training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical cooldown I use which is great for a post badminton workout looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steady, easy slow skipping for 3-5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Child‚Äôs pose, 30 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Butterfly stretch, 30 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hamstring stretch, 30 seconds each leg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glute stretch, 30 seconds each leg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standing forward bend, 30 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quad stretch, 30 seconds each leg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calf stretch, 30 seconds each leg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shoulder stretch, 30 seconds each arm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chest stretch, 30 seconds each side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be enough to target all the areas of the body and crucially the lower half for badminton, all the lunging and twisting needs good flexibility in the hips and legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other tips to help avoid injury and next day soreness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this advice will aid in avoiding the dreaded aches and pains that can follow the days after a hard workout of badminton session, especially the static stretching which will stop blood pooling in the larger muscle groups in the lower body such as the quads and hamstrings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd recommend everybody to couple a healthy fitness regime and lifestyle with a just as healthy approach to food and dieting. It goes without saying that all the exercise in the world won‚Äôt save you if your body is not getting the nutrients it needs to grow and heal. I‚Äôd always recommend having something to hand that is high in protein post-exercise to consume. Your body will use that protein to build and repair muscle to be stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something often unmentioned is the benefits of a good night‚Äôs sleep in relation to exercise. Our bodies are constantly working each day and if we‚Äôre training and putting ourselves under more workload we need time to recover, sleep is our bodies way of recovering from the events of the day. During sleep, a lot of the bodies healing and regenerative abilities kick into gear meaning getting to bed at a decent time will help avoid the stiffness and the ache the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It‚Äôs what every elite level athlete does&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at Badminton‚Äôs Best we always look at the best players in the world to learn from and every single one of them will do warm-ups and cooldowns. Why would you avoid something that is so fundamental to keeping fit and injury free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take away these routines and try them next time your at badminton or training as a way to warm-up and cooldown. These are the basics and there are countless ways to do both.

At the‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://www.badmintonsbest.com/blog/can-i-play-badminton-whilst-pregnant/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.badmintonsbest.com/blog/can-i-play-badminton-whilst-pregnant/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fun fact, I once had the honour of training and playing with the Olympic silver medalists Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson, true story. At the time Gail Emms was expecting her first child which would turn out to be a boy and despite being heavily pregnant at the time was still able and willing to do the group training session I was attending alongside Nathan. Despite being very heavily pregnant she managed to do the training session helping other and managed a shortened mixed game at the end playing against Nathan and each of them playing with someone from the session. Obviously being an Olympian level athlete and previous world champion to boot, a short match for fun should be no problem, right? You can still play Badminton while pregnant, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The answer is that you probably shouldn‚Äôt. You can still play keeping it at a very social and casual way but anything more could put yourself and the baby at risk. Badminton is a high paced sport that requires agility, speed and a lot of explosive movement. All doctors and health professionals will recommend avoiding high-intensity exercise and sports where you could either fall or come into any type of collision be it person or object. So you might still be able to play but it‚Äôs best avoided. Let‚Äôs look at in a little more detail why you probably shouldn‚Äôt be playing Badminton whilst pregnant and what you can do instead to keep you fit, healthy and safe for you and your baby-to-be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Badminton is high-intensity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst pregnant, especially in the later months, most professionals recommend exercise that can be taken at your own pace. Unless you decided to just hit the shuttle around for practice and not be chasing after it like in a match then you should be fine. Playing matches whether competitively or socially requires a lot of movement and excursion that would put anybody under strain nevermind a body carrying a pregnancy. Putting a pregnant body under that strain especially if your bump is getting considerably bigger might prove too much to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breathlessness is another problem, if you‚Äôre constantly getting out of breath you won‚Äôt be supplying enough oxygen to yourself or the baby. Your whole body is in overdrive whilst pregnant, you‚Äôre looking after two bodies in effect, your body simply needs all the energy it can get to support the growth of the baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It requires flexibility and agility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexibility and agility often two things taken for granted, it‚Äôs not until you stop playing for a while or suffer an injury of some kind and come back to play that you realise how much is needed of both to play badminton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally the further along in your pregnancy you are the less mobile you are likely to be. A growing baby bump and other changes in the body will only become more pronounced over time. Finding it harder to touch your toes or simply to bend over or down is the result of natural changes for a pregnant body, your body changes to accommodate the baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to be light of your feet and able to change direction at any moment during a match, not only is it going to be harder to stay light on your feet but harder to stay on your feet, in general, the further into pregnancy you are. Your centre of gravity is lowered by the baby bump‚Äôs weight which can cause you to feel unsteady and of balance as this change happens. Your body is used to the centre of gravity being in a slightly different spot and so needs to adjust. It obvious to know that falling down or bumping your baby bump is not a good idea and one of the things to be avoided at all costs, not only could you hurt the baby but you could really hurt yourself badly if you fall awkwardly or on your bump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing directions quickly is also another no-go as it‚Äôs advised to avoid any exercise with a lot of sudden, jerking or bouncy movements. You‚Äôre more likely to do damage to the baby with a lot of jostling around and it‚Äôs not going to be comfortable for yourself either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Badminton can be unsafe in certain situations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem unfair to rule out badminton as a form of exercise for those who are really passionate about it but it‚Äôs not just pregnant women who should be mindful, there are situations in badminton that can seriously cause bad injury to anyone of any fitness, skill or ability. Let‚Äôs go through some of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shuttle in the eye&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not often talked about but should be is the risk of being hit in the eye with the shuttle. This risk exists even at the elite level of badminton, in particular, doubles players who play at the front of the court are most at risk of this. If the opponent to kill the shuttle at the net and the other player at the front is unaware of what is about to happen it only takes a little bit of bad luck and the shuttle could hit the player in the eye as they won‚Äôt have enough time to react and get out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a rare occurrence but I have seen it happen before, fortunately, the times I have seen it the person has avoided having the shuttle hit them directly in the eyeball and has instead just been struck in the face which will still hurt but a lot less likely to inflict long-term damage. Your eyesight is not to be taken for granted pregnant or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Slipping and falling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badminton is a dynamic sport and requires fast footwork and a lot of court coverage, unfortunately, I see a lot of social and low-level club players playing in venues that are not suited to the sport. My biggest complaint about venues will always come back to the flooring, everything else can be tolerated but something I refuse to do is play in a venue with poor flooring as it becomes too easy to suffer an injury just for the fact that the floor is slippy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds very picky but it‚Äôs absolutely necessary to play somewhere with good flooring to prevent simple and avoidable injuries, it‚Äôs just not worth it. A very extreme case but a friend of mine once broke his arm because he slipped and fell playing in a venue that was not looked after properly and that‚Äôs just wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clashing racquets and worse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You often see in doubles people clashing racquets going for the same shot, it happens more with beginners and with players not familiar with playing together. I‚Äôve seen many a racquet smashed beyond repair after such a collision but that is nothing compared to what can happen if you clash with the other person themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again very rarely seen but there are situations where you are at risk from being hit by someone else‚Äôs racquet, the most common case is in doubles when the two players are front and back and are attacking, the player at the back has just hit a shot and the opponents have returned it trying to put the shuttle over the front player, the front player comes back to get the shuttle easier and the back player comes forward to meet it early and the result is not pretty. The front player is going to hit the back player coming backwards and swinging his racquet for the shot or the back player is going to hit the front player as they travel back and could possibly hit them in the head which could be very serious. In this case, the back player should be aware and get out of the way of the front player who cannot see behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So badminton is not such a safe sport as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Still want to be happy and healthy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all of this strengthens the argument of avoiding badminton whilst you are pregnant but here are some recommended forms of exercise that you can enjoy before getting back on court again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swimming, the buoyancy created by water is perfect to reduce the pulling weight of the baby bump and can be very relieving for the back. Swimming is also as much as you make it so you can push it or relax as much as you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking, taking a simple walk out and about can do wonders. Not needing to walk long distances to get the benefit keeps you active and you can vary your distance and time spent walking to suit you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yoga, to an extent it‚Äôs very good for keeping you supple and flexible. Some parts of Yoga becomes impractical the further into pregnancy before but there are always things to do for any fitness level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs sad news that it‚Äôs just not safe to play badminton whilst pregnant but it‚Äôs never 100% safe for everyone anyway. I‚Äôd recommend on taking a step back from badminton to really enjoy the important thing here which is the pregnancy itself. Life comes and goes so quickly that we‚Äôll often miss things if we‚Äôre distracted or busy etc. Enjoy the time during pregnancy as it is one of the most special experiences in life and that‚Äôs worth missing badminton for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;

How the Best do it]]></title><description><![CDATA[Probably the most asked question, the most search topic and the thing the majority of people fixate on when they first start playing‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://www.badmintonsbest.com/blog/how-to-hit-a-killer-badminton-smash/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.badmintonsbest.com/blog/how-to-hit-a-killer-badminton-smash/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Probably the most asked question, the most search topic and the thing the majority of people fixate on when they first start playing badminton. It‚Äôs definitely the most exciting shot to play and watch in the sport, there really isn‚Äôt anything else quite like it. Seeing some of the greats play this iconic shot is jaw-dropping to say the least but how do they do it? What‚Äôs the key to a killer smash?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the best smashers in the game like Lin Dan, Fu Haifeng, Goh V Shem, Tan Boon Heong to name a few, you start to see patterns in how they approach and execute the shot. &lt;strong&gt;Good footwork to get right behind the shuttle, power through the legs and jump to get up and meet the shuttle at the highest point possible, hit the shuttle just in front of your body line and push the shuttle down to get a steep angle, placement is as crucial as power but both are needed and finally keep a fluid motion and pronate the arm to get the last second whip-like snap to power through the shuttle. These are just the components of the smash, you need to practise all of this and then some. Mastering each of these elements of the shot and you‚Äôll be killer on court.&lt;/strong&gt; Having highlighted all of that, let‚Äôs go into more detail on each point step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Footwork, get behind and up to the shuttle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badminton‚Äôs is all about footwork, good footwork will improve everything else along with it, poor footwork means you won‚Äôt be in balance or in a good position to play the next shot. If you watch Lee Chong Wei‚Äôs footwork, he‚Äôs one of the best examples, you can easily see how well he gets behind the shuttle. When the shuttle is traveling he never lets it go behind him so in practise he‚Äôs never trying to catch up with the shuttle instead he‚Äôs ahead of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting behind the shuttle provides the opportunity to be able to strike the shuttle above your head and slightly in front of you which makes it easier to hit the shuttle steeper. If your leaning back trying to reach the shuttle behind you, it will be so much harder or even impossible to get the racquet over the shuttle to bring it down. If you watch the professionals, especially players like Fun Haifeng, you‚Äôll see how they almost come over the top of the shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting behind the shuttle fully also allows you to transfer your body weight forwards adding more momentum to your shot. Naturally letting your body follow through means you‚Äôll hit with a lot more force rather than falling backwards or being stationary when hitting the smash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often overlooked in this aspect is not just how getting behind the shuttle improves the smash but also how you‚Äôre able to recover after the smash if the other player/players get the smash back. You‚Äôll be in better balance and be able to follow up on the smash to continue or finish the rally. This is so important especially in singles where opportunities arise when the opponent can only make a weak reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reach up high, take it early&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs often seen on promotional material and posters around the world wherever the sport is played, the big jump smash and the poise and technique needed to hit an incredible smash. Taking Lee Chong Wei as an example again you‚Äôll often see him as much as 3 feet off the ground, leaping into the air to hit the big winner. The reason the jump can be so important is for angle and placement. If you just wanted to hit the fastest smash you could do that whilst standing but you‚Äôll most likely hit a very flat smash and the opponent would only need to be able to react to the right direction to return the smash. Jumping up on the smash allows for a steeper angle so that it can be hit with speed and placement, just try getting a smash back that is low down near your feet and then try and get a smash back which is near your mid-drift and see which is harder to return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the shuttle early provides lots of opportunities for variety as well which is why you see players really rush back when the shuttle is lifted. Meeting the shuttle early leaves the opponent with more shots to worry about, you could smash it or just as easily drop it or clear it or any variety of shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are times when getting up to the shuttle really high can be a disadvantage, if you‚Äôre suspended in the air for a short time you‚Äôre recovery time for the next shot will naturally be slower, so if you hit a poor quality shot and the opponent gets it back it could be difficult to reach the next shot depending on the return. You see it a lot more in singles that the players don‚Äôt always go for the biggest jump when hitting from the back of the court to avoid exposing themselves in their recovery from the shot, instead waiting for the right opportunity where they are most likely to be able to inflict damage to the opponents defence with a killer smash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Angle, placement and power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned in the previous section getting up to the shuttle early is vital in hitting a killer badminton smash, the steepness in angle you can create by doing this makes it harder for opponents to return as they have to get down low to reach the shuttle and naturally from there they can only play an upwards shot giving you a more favourable return. Creating angle along with proper placement and power in the smash can make all the difference, so let‚Äôs go over placement and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about placement we mean where you aim your smash at the opponent or opponents. In singles, it is more common to smash down the line (the inner sideline used to mark the boundary for singles) and to cross smash (smashing the shuttle cross court from your position). The reason for placing the smashes like this in singles is because your opponent is only one person it‚Äôs more difficult to cover the width of the court and hence there is more space to attack them down the lines. It is not often seen but the other smash variation is a body smash, often referred to as ‚Äúsmashing into the body‚Äù where you aim directly at the opponent often targeting their racquet arm hip or shoulder. There are times when smashing at the opponent in singles is beneficial, either when the player is constantly expecting the smashes to go down the line and your smashes need some variation to keep them guessing or against tall players smashing at the body can be quite effective as it‚Äôs harder to move longer arms and legs in a smaller confined space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When playing doubles it‚Äôs more common to either smash down the middle (in between the two defending players) or body smashing more. Hitting the smash down the middle takes the angles of reply away from the defenders, the reason doubles players try and do this is to try and give their partner who should be at the front of the court the best opportunity to intercept or kill the next shot, let me explain further. If you smash down the line in doubles with two players on the other side standing side by side you don‚Äôt get much advantage from aiming down the line because all they need to do is reach with their racquet out and they can get it and good players will be able to drive the shuttle back bypassing your partner at the front of the court. If you smash in between the two players not only can you create confusion between the two, as they might think the other one should retrieve it, but the shuttle will have to travel from the middle of their side which cuts out the opportunity to cross the shuttle or play it back down the line. In doubles, the aim should always be to set up the front player to finish the rally. It is much easier to kill the rally from the net from a weak reply then to try and completely smash through a pair waiting for exactly that, a smash!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smashing at the body is also useful in doubles for the same reason, when you smash directly at the opponent you should be aiming for the racquet hip (the hip of the side of which they hold their racquet, right-handed player hit the right hip etc), the racquet shoulder and down by the feet. Aiming for the hip and shoulder is effective because it forces the player to sway their body to one side in order to be able to defend the shot, pick up and racquet and try playing an imaginary defensive shot aimed at your hip or shoulder and notice how you can‚Äôt angle the racquet without moving yourself first. If the opponent doesn‚Äôt react quick enough they simply won‚Äôt be able to play a shot back and if they do react they‚Äôre more likely to make a mistake. Smashing down near the feet makes it harder to reach the shuttle, the other pair is covering the width of the court but if your smash is steep they‚Äôll struggle to even reach it before it hits the floor. If they manage to get it back the shuttle has to go up giving either the front player a chance to intercept of you a chance to attack again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally I think smash power should be the last thing to think about when trying to improve the smash because if you could smash at 400kph like the professionals but couldn‚Äôt control the placement or the angle then good players will simply feed off of that power and use it against you, having said that it is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people think hitting the smash as hard as you can everytime is what you should aim for and that‚Äôs simply not true. Watch Lin Dan play at any point in his career and you can definitely tell that he doesn‚Äôt always hit his smashes as hard as he can 100% of the time he more than not waits for the easy opportunity to go full pace with the smash because he is most likely to win the rally at that point and can afford to commit to following it up and in doubles you can see the likes of Lee Yong Dae and Hendra Setiawan don‚Äôt often play as rear court players in doubles but when they do they‚Äôre calculated in picking and choosing when to smash with full power. Opponents can get used to the speed of the other players smash as the game goes on and develop a sort of rhythm on when and how to expect the smash so disrupting that rhythm can be very effective. If you want to learn how to improve the power of your smash then keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hitting the shuttle and the one-inch punch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racquet technique is so important of badminton as it is a game of small margins so having the right technique can make all the difference to getting a better smash. Looking at Lin Dan, one of the best technicians in the game, he‚Äôs the prime example when looking at the actual technique of hitting the smash. The technique of the smash has three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push the racquet shoulder back and turn the body side-on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach up high and forwards with the non-racquet hand to the space where you will strike the shuttle along with raising the racquet up making sure the racquet is above shoulder height&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swing through with an overhead action and focus on pronating the forearm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre aware of who Bruce Lee is then you probably know what the ‚Äúone-inch punch‚Äù is. The one-inch punch is a punching exercise from the martial art form called Kung Fu but was heavily popularised by Bruce Lee and comprises of delivery a punch without a big windup and instead over a very short distance, as short as one-inch. The idea behind the technique is that you should be able to deliver the same amount of force over a shorter distance if the force is applied in a focused and accurate way. This relates to the badminton smash wherein the majority of the smash power is achieved in the last part of the technique, the forearm pronation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forearm pronation acts like a twisted elastic band in which it tries to get back to its original shape. When the elastic band is twisted it becomes tight and creates elastic energy which is then released when the elastic band is released from the twisting. The same thing happens when you pronate your forearm, your muscles are twisted slightly and that creates elastic energy in your muscles that want to get back to a resting position. This all happens in a very small space when you look at it in the big picture of the entire shot. The better you can master power in the forearm the better your smash will become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Follow through with the body&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newton‚Äôs second law is simple, force: mass x acceleration, in the last section the majority of the acceleration part of that equation for the badminton smash is in the stroke and some of the mass comes from the racquet but even more mass can be added into the equation if you follow ‚Äúthrough the shuttle‚Äù. This simply means to make sure you are least traveling forward slightly when you hit the smash and not falling backwards or remaining stationary during the shot. If you hit the smash whilst traveling forwards as you hit the shuttle you‚Äôll be adding some of your own bodyweight into the shot, you‚Äôre adding more mass into the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following through with your body gives you more balance and more momentum so is important not just for the smash but for the next shot you might have to play as well. You see it time after time in Lin Dan‚Äôs hay day where he‚Äôd hit a big smash and follow it up by killing the returned block at the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practise, practise, practise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading all of this there is nothing left to do but go out there and practise. I would always recommend finding a good coach who can coach the fundamentals extremely well. Practise is only worth doing if it is good quality practise, spending hours and hours practising something the wrong way won‚Äôt improve anything. Practise with purpose, practise with patience and an open mind and practise with 100% effort and enjoy it, it‚Äôs proven we excel more easily in the things that we enjoy then the things we don‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep watching the best in badminton and try and pick out some of the things mentioned here, learn from them as they‚Äôre the best for a reason.

One of the things I‚Äôve learnt more about is about strings for badminton racquets. It‚Äôs not often talked about as most people never end up changing the strings they use for their racquets because they take their stringers recommendation, which is definitely not a bad thing. I, however, wanted to learn more about the types of strings and which ones were best for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As it is with a lot of things to do with equipment and sport in general, the best of something can mostly come down to personal taste and preference. But the three most popular stings in the badminton community are Yonex BG80, Yonex BG65 Ti and Yonex BG66 Ultimax. Let‚Äôs have a closer look at what makes these strings the most popular and also some other badminton fan favourites.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Badminton strings breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I set out to learn more about strings and my racquet in general I naturally looked at what the best in the world were using and found &lt;a href=&quot;http://sticksmash.com/2016/11/07/string-tension-lin-dan-lee-chong-wei-use/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://sticksmash.com/2016/11/07/string-tension-lin-dan-lee-chong-wei-use/&quot;&gt;Stick Smash&lt;/a&gt; that has photos of stringing request sheets from some of the world‚Äôs top players like Lin Dan and Lee Chong Wei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the list of players and seeing that most of them are using similar strings at similar tensions that there must be a reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking people I know who do stringing for me and other players and have been doing it for years, some longer than I‚Äôve been alive have told me more about strings and how they work with the racquet with tension and elasticity. They weren‚Äôt surprised that even the best in the world are using strings that are widely available for all players of all standards. They told me about the three characteristics to look at when picking a string which are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The string durability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amount of repulsion the string has&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the feel of the string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let‚Äôs start off now with the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;String durability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is as simple as it sounds, different strings are either less or more durable when compared to one another. A strings durability is determined by what it is made of, the tension applied when strung in the racquet but mainly affected by the gauge (the thickness) of the string. The differences between a thick string and a thing string are fractions of millimetres but that‚Äôs all it takes to make a string more or less durable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all manufacturers of badminton strings work on a scale of one to ten for rating a strings durability. The higher the rating the more durable the string. The measures of gauges range from 0.6mm to 0.7mm and above but I have never seen a gauge higher than 0.7mm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durability is important in choosing a racquet string because durability affects the feel of the strings and the shots. Strings with a higher durability are thicker, between 0.68mm to 0.7mm in diameter, and provide a longer lasting string and more value for money for those who don‚Äôt need to change their strings too often (more for casual/leisurely players). More durable strings are thicker and because of that they lose a certain amount of accuracy and control when hitting Thinner strings are naturally the opposite, they don‚Äôt last as long and are easier to break because of the same force exerted over a smaller surface area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best players in the world choose strings that are slightly on the thinner side because they require a great deal of control and precision from their shots. At the same time they don‚Äôt want to go through a lot of racquets during practice so they tend to have something in between for durability and accept a little loss of control will be negligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For beginners and intermediates, it‚Äôs recommended to do the same as the best and get something in between. One of the best examples is Yonex‚Äôs BG65 Ti string which a very durable string and at the other end of the spectrum is Yonex‚Äôs Aerosonic string which is one of the thinnest strings any company has made and this is the best example of a string with very poor durability but is going to be more accurate due to the reduced contact area with the shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing strings with the right durability all depends on your abilities as a player and how often you are willing to have your strings replaced. Consistently hitting your shots clean then thinner strings will only make you better but if you‚Äôre inconsistent then you‚Äôll be breaking strings too often to repair which can add up money wise as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;String repulsion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badminton strings are all made from materials that are elastic. Whether it‚Äôs multifilament nylon or some other material they are all made to stretch much like an elastic band. The elasticity of the string is what provides repulsion, as you hit the shuttle the strings stretch under the pressure applied and then they snap back to their original position powering the shuttle away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinner strings are known for having more repulsion power than thicker strings as the force of hitting the shuttle is spread over a smaller surface area which concentrates the force applied. Strings with higher repulsion ratings have to have a trade-off in durability then because they are much thinner so more likely to snap on miss-hitting a shot. The hitting sound with high repulsion is another attribute that improves, the shuttle sounds very crisp when hit right on the sweet spot of the racquet and when you‚Äôre able to control the repulsion of the strings you can benefit from greater accuracy with softer shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The feel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different strings from different brands all feel very different, it‚Äôs hard to find two strings that ever feel like another. Yonex uses a classification of soft, medium and hard feeling strings and the best way to describe it is this; soft strings tend to feel more bouncy and stretchy, they feel like they stretch easier and hard strings feel very solid and rigid without bending much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft strings are better for players who need easier repulsion and power in shots without exerting as much effort into the racquet. Doubles players tend to lean towards strings on the medium to soft side for strings because rallies can be very thick and fast and need to generate more power from shorter movements with the racquet whereas singles players quite like using the harder strings as they have more time between shots to prepare and can get the most out of the smashes where they try to win the rally outright. Soft strings have a downside because they stretch easier under force it means that they don‚Äôt hold the tension when restrung as well as harder strings, if not replaced regularly they will slacken naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard feeling strings give a good sense of the contact with the shuttle, they feel less bouncy and stiffer so you can feel the shuttles impact a little more through the racquet which provides good feedback for softer touch shots where you need to be very accurate. When hitting harder shots they provide great repulsion with enough force replied but without they can feel very difficult to get much out of, it can feel like hitting with a wooden bat or something. These strings are definitely not the best for beginners when beginners should be focussing on consistent returning of the shuttle before trying to hone accuracy and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stringing tension&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;String tension applies to all strings and racquets, not just this brand or that, the string tension is normally measured in pounds and is a subject often discussed at great lengths. I‚Äôll only touch upon the subject here with how it relates with which strings are best for you but I plan to write another article about stringing tension later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stringing tension matters a great deal when picking your chosen string. If you‚Äôre a top level player with good technique and very consistent hitting skills you‚Äôll most likely be stringing at the higher end of the tension range (27-31lbs) you‚Äôll still be able to use thinner strings without having to worry about them breaking constantly but if you‚Äôre an intermediate player stringing at the same tension with the same thin strings you‚Äôll find you‚Äôll be breaking more often from mis-hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High tension and thin strings are always going to cause the string to break sooner so for a lot of players the choice of string should partly marry up with how tight you have your strings strung. More durable strings would be better for those who want higher tension but also want to have their strings last longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So which should you buy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of this is down to personal preference, it‚Äôs always better to try a wide variety of recommended strings to find which works best for you. What‚Äôs best for one person isn‚Äôt always best for another, everyone‚Äôs different. Every player has different touch, technique and play styles and they should try to find what‚Äôs right for them. My personal recommendations as I have tried many string types are the three mentioned at the beginning; Yonex BG80, Yonex BG65 Ti and Yonex BG66 Ultimax are all great strings and if you want a more detailed look at each strings attributes then take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yonex.co.uk/_assets/files/18617_2018-UK-Badminton-Catalogue_Web.pdf&quot;&gt;Yonex catalogue&lt;/a&gt; under the strings section.

One of the basics which is often overlooked is how you hold the racquet or your ‚Äúgrip‚Äù. I had a habit of letting the handle of the racquet turn too much in my grip, I was holding it too loose, and as a result, I wasn‚Äôt getting power or accuracy in some shots because when I hit the shuttle it was never with a consistent grip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The two keys to being able to hold the racquet with a consistent and good grip are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting the correct shape of the hand (should be like a handshake)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holding the racquet with a relaxed grip&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Let‚Äôs go into more depth about grips and also the racquet itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The racquet handle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racquet handle is something to take note of, the handle of a badminton racquet isn‚Äôt unique but it is essential to explain the shape of it and why it is the way it is. Bats such as baseball or a cricket bat are completely rounded, a badminton racquet is hexagonal. If you look at the bottom of the handle there‚Äôs is often a logo and there you can see the hexagonal shape of the handle. It‚Äôs designed this way because unlike bats which part of the handle and how you hold it matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forehand grip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forehand grip used for all shots, you guessed it, on your forehand side which is just which hand you hold your racquet on. If you are right handed then your forehand side of you is your right side and if you are left-handed then your forehand side is your left side, easy peasy. It‚Äôs important to note before moving on; don‚Äôt overcomplicate the grip. It‚Äôs easy to master if you keep things simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to think about the forehand grip is to think about shaking somebody‚Äôs hand. You form a V shape with your thumb and index finger and the other three fingers wrap around the handle for stability but you should be able to just hold the racquet with your index finger and thumb. Take the racquet in your V-shaped hand and have the middle between your index finger and thumb sit on the bevel (the bevel is one of the narrower faces on the grip, remember how we explained the handle shape is hexagonal?). When you have the racquet in your hand the easiest way to check the grip is right is to hold the racquet straight out in front of you and you should only be able to see the side of the racquet and not be able to see the strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forehand grip is as simple as that, practice this sat at home and just get comfortable holding the racquet this way. It‚Äôs easy to overcomplicate things when it seems so simple, but simpler is always better in my book when executed well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Backhand grip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backhand grip is used for all shots, you guessed right again, on your backhand side which is just the opposite side to your forehand side. The reason for using a different grip on this side will become apparent when we explain further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people find that the backhand grip is actually easier and more natural than the forehand grip. To turn your forehand grip into and backhand grip simply turn your thumb over onto the flat of the racquet handle rather than sitting across the bevel and let your fingers naturally adjust slightly. Making this adjustment doesn‚Äôt seem like very much but it will allow you to ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù the racquet with your thumb to play most backhand shots. The thumb will stabilise the racquet when hitting so the racquet stays put in your new grip. A lot of people find it harder to play the overhead shots with a backhand at first but find that all the shots that aren‚Äôt overhead are a lot easier since you can use the power of your thumb to play the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Switching back and forth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the two basic grips that everyone needs and with these two grips and no adjustments you can play every shot on the court. One thing that can often go overlooked is making sure to practice switching back and forth from your forehand grip to your backhand grip. This is essential when playing doubles and are on the defensive as you‚Äôll need to switch from forehand to backhand depending on which side the opponents try to attack you from. A simple exercise is to sit on the couch at home and just practice shifting back and forth from forehand to backhand. Doing this and practicing in training and playing and it will become instinctive in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some coaches refer to another grip type called a ‚Äúneutral grip‚Äù which is halfway between a forehand and backhand grip where you can quickly decide which grip to use for the shot. This isn‚Äôt a necessity to learn as making sure you‚Äôre not gripping the racquet too tight and you‚Äôll be able to switch back and forth with ease, which brings us to the next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stay relaxed, hold the racquet loosely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both grips, you need to hold the racquet in a relaxed way, for the forehand you should be able to hold the racquet with your index finger and thumb and same for the backhand. Keeping the grip relaxed will give you more flexibility in maneuvering the racquet and allow you to switch between forehand and backhand easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so important that I would recommend sitting and holding your racquet with just the finger and thumb and seeing how it feels, the other fingers should just stabilise and wrap around the grip. Having the grip too tight will lead to an elbow injury commonly known as ‚Äútennis elbow‚Äù as it‚Äôs very common for tennis players to get this. Tennis elbow comes from gripping the racquet too tight and the muscles and tendons in your arm are unable to stretch naturally. If your muscles are already tight because you are gripping your racquet too hard and tensing as you play the shot your muscles and tendons are going to be put under severe strain. If you come away with this article with anything let it be this, stay relaxed, it‚Äôs awful to see people who enjoy the sport so much start to suffer due to a lack of knowing and ending up with injuries that can hurt over the long term. Let‚Äôs keep this in mind and stay injury free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hitting a shot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After practicing the grips in isolation you should then make sure when you come to hitting shots that you keep the same grip you practiced. It is very easy to slip back into old habits so make a conscious effort to keep the grip right and don‚Äôt be tempted to mess around with it too much. Remember, keep it simple is always best. I see other players spinning the racquet in their hands in between points and often find myself doing the same but you can find that when you start the next rally that your grip is slightly off because you‚Äôve been spinning the racquet in your hand, try to avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When hitting any shot make sure tighten your grip on impact but only slightly. Grip the handle to keep the head of the racquet still on impact so no power of accuracy is lost with the racquet head moving around too much. Firm but not tight to avoid tennis elbow like we mentioned earlier. Following all the points mentioned earlier will allow you to have a smooth and clean swing. Keeping the grip loose keeps the arm from tensing up for the swing, muscles don‚Äôt like to be tight or tense when they need to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Holding it long or short&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we‚Äôre moving onto more advanced tips here but there are benefits for holding the grip either shorter (closer to the shaft of the racquet) or longer (closer to the butt/bottom of the handle). For beginners, I would say keep the grip in between so have the little finger of your hand about an inch or two up from the bottom of the handle rather than at the extremes and use this length for all shots. This will keep a consistency of racquet length when first starting out for hand-eye-coordination and will be easier to hit all shots.
For the more advanced players holding the racquet longer provides a bigger lever for swinging which means you‚Äôll be able to deliver more power its basic science. The longer grip will make it harder to play shorter shots such as defensive blocks and flicks and playing in the flat mid-court. It‚Äôs more common to see singles players with slightly longer grip because they have more time between shots. If you were playing doubles holding the racquet longer constantly becomes more difficult when you need to play multiple shots in a row with very little time in between each shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages of playing with a shorter grip are equal opposites for having a longer grip. It‚Äôs easier to play shorter, sharper shots with a short grip because it becomes a smaller lever to try and rotate. The natural disadvantage is that with a shorter level it‚Äôs harder to get the same amount of power in a smash or a clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other types of grips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other types of grips beyond the basic forehand and backhand, depending on the situation and the type of player (singles or doubles player etc) these might not be used often:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neutral grip - as mentioned before, the resting grip that allows players to quickly switch to forehand or backhand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pan-handle grip - I mean the name says it all, you hold the racquet you would like a pan-handle, rarely used but the few rare times it is used is for playing the frontcourt in doubles to intercept shots going overhead where switching to forehand or backhand would be too slow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bevel grip - used as a variation for playing backhand clears and drops, it allows for more rotation of the racquet by resting the thumb on the bevel rather than the flat so the racquet can turn enough to play a cross-court shot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To summarise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in summary, please remember the two points mentioned at the start of this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting the correct shape of the hand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holding the racquet with a relaxed grip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the keys to getting the correct badminton grip. Watch videos of the best players and try and look at how they‚Äôre holding the racquet when they play. Some of the best to look at are Ratchanok Intanon, Tai Tzu-Ying, Lin Dan and Taufik Hidayat. Keep in mind the points made and here make time to practice, you can do it anywhere you have your racquet. Get this fundamental right and you‚Äôll be setting off on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[5 Reasons Badminton Will Help You Lose Weight]]></title><description><![CDATA[Everybody wants to be trim, everybody wants to stay in shape but not everybody enjoys going to the gym, I believe the best answer is finding‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://www.badmintonsbest.com/blog/five-reasons-badminton-will-help-you-lose-weight/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.badmintonsbest.com/blog/five-reasons-badminton-will-help-you-lose-weight/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Everybody wants to be trim, everybody wants to stay in shape but not everybody enjoys going to the gym, I believe the best answer is finding a sport you love is the best way to get in shape as you‚Äôll enjoy getting a sweat on more and it won‚Äôt feel like such a chore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing Badminton is a great way to lose weight as it ticks a number of boxes that the best trainers recommend to lose weight. Playing Badminton a couple of times a week can dramatically improve your weight loss progress so let‚Äôs look at five reasons why playing Badminton will help you lose weight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It‚Äôs just like HIIT training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big plus for Badminton, because of the nature of the sport you need to move fast to cover the court especially if you‚Äôre playing singles. If you watch the best you can see how they‚Äôre footwork flows into a seamless display but in fact, a single rally consists of lots of small very sharp and explosive movements followed by a short cooldown between rallies. It‚Äôs precisely this aspect of the sport that makes it good for fat burning, HIIT (high-intensity interval training) follows the same aspect of short but fully engaged exercises that require full effort on each go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you play make sure to give it your all, keep on your toes constantly and be active on and off the shuttle, this will drastically increase the level of play as well as your fat burning potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The better you become the better your fat burning potential will get and it‚Äôs estimated that you can burn roughly 300 calories an hour at a social level of play. Playing at a faster pace and increasing the intensity of play will increase the calorie burn. Professional players can burn as much as 500 calories per hour of play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thirsty thirsty work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing Badminton works up quite a sweat even if you‚Äôre a beginner, it involves the whole body moving and reacting to the play of the game. You‚Äôll definitely get a good sweat on and find yourself getting very thirsty very quickly. Drinking more water has always been a must for physical activity and getting more water into your system helps boost your metabolism, cleanse your body of waste and helps you feel less hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drinking more water also helps stop your body going into water retention mode wherein it tries to save water because it isn‚Äôt being replaced often enough which means you‚Äôll shed a few pounds of water weight just by drinking more water to replace it. It is recommended to drink before you eat throughout the day as well, ice cold water if you can as this can boost your metabolism and your body absorbs colder water faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally drinking more water instead of fizzy and/or sugary drinks means you‚Äôll be cutting out a lot of rubbish and calories that would otherwise go into your system which anyone would have trouble to burn off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It gets your heart pumping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we‚Äôve already mentioned Badminton is an intense, high octane sport with lots of dynamic movement and agility. All of this is definitely going to get your heart pumping and it‚Äôs precisely that which will get you into what scientists call the ‚Äúfat burning zone‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fat burning zone is the heart rate at which you burn the most calories the most efficiently. It can be calculated by taking your max heart rate which is 220 - your age and then calculating 60%-70% percent of that number. Example; 220 - 21: 199 then 199 √ó 0.6: 119.4 beats per minute or 199 √ó 0.7: 139.3 beats per minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people make the mistake in that increasing the intensity more and more and more will burn more and more calories but there becomes a point where it‚Äôs no more efficient that easing of a little bit and lasting through the exercise for a bit longer. Not to mention it becomes possibly dangerous to go overboard and physically impossible to any more benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the weight loss, it‚Äôs so important in this day and age to keep your heart healthy and the heart is a muscle just like any other in the body in that it needs to be exercised. Not quite as drastic as the saying ‚Äúuse it or you‚Äôll lose it‚Äù but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Serious afterburn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the high intensity the sport can have and raising your heart rate up after a good hour of playing with at a considerable intensity you get the benefit of the ‚Äúafterburn‚Äù or the scientific term ‚Äúexcess post-exercise oxygen consumption‚Äù which basically means that you carry on burning calories after the workout is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information from studies on this effect tells us that this effect can last for several hours after playing and the harder you play, the harder you get your heart pumping the greater the afterburn will be. You don‚Äôt have to play for a full hour to get this effect though, if you play for 30 minutes at a reasonable intensity you‚Äôll still get the benefit it will just burn fewer calories, everyone‚Äôs a winner!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research notes that eating after exercise is better than eating before you play as your less likely to get an upset belly from being full before playing and your body will turn to its reserve energy sources quicker when you don‚Äôt have much in your digestive system. Make your post play meal healthy and wholesome and rich in lean proteins to fuel your cells for regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It‚Äôs fun!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs face it, it can be often overlooked that the enjoyment of an activity often determines how much you get out of that activity. If you don‚Äôt enjoy camping you‚Äôd never get the most out of a full weekend sleeping out in the woods, same with physical exercise, if you don‚Äôt enjoy going to the gym you‚Äôll be hard-pressed to get the results you want and why spend time doing something just because you feel you have to when you can reach the same goal in a more enjoyable way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research backs this as people who do little and often and keep a consistent routine with exercise do better in the long run with weight loss than those who try to make big changes in short spaces of time. In the book ‚ÄúThe Power of Habit‚Äù there is something called the Habit Loop where there is a cue, the routine and the reward. In our case with Badminton, the cue is that we want to lose weight, the routine is going off to Badminton and the reward is the delight of winning, exercising and giving our body a good workout, socializing with the people we play with and much more. The point is that you‚Äôll more likely stick to it because it creates the perfect habit loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are just five reasons why Badminton will help you lose weight. Please feel free to leave a comment below and let me know if this gets you excited to start playing or to play more! Maybe there is another weight loss benefit I haven‚Äôt covered?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[About Badmintons Best]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hi fellow Badminton fan, I‚Äôm Liam.

I‚Äôm the creator and face of the brand BadmintonsBest! Welcome and thank you for visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been playing Badminton for over 17 years. Second only to my family, Badminton is my biggest passion in life. If I‚Äôm not with family I‚Äôm either playing or watching Badminton with the mission to be the best I can be. This site is where I can share what I‚Äôve learnt from playing, being coached and from watching‚Ä¶ Badmintons Best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off playing when I was 11 years old. My mother was the person who got me started with Badminton. She used to take me to our local recreation centre to play socially on a Wednesday night. The people there were so encouraging and supportive that I improved very quickly. My mother realised I was fast outgrowing the beginner standard and that‚Äôs where my father came in. I‚Äôve always enjoyed improving and seeing myself grow. My father found my first coach and just like that I became immersed in the Badminton world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Mission Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To get more people playing Badminton and help them reach their best potential.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Vision Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To be a world-class resource to help people enjoy and improve playing Badminton and become the best they can be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The purpose of this blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this blog as a passion project. To write and detail all my experience and knowledge I have gained about the sport of Badminton. Through this website and brand, I help others improve in Badminton and bring new people into this amazing sport. I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to meet so many amazing people because of this sport and I want to share it and spread it throughout the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy the content found here and on our social media channels including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Like and follow us to receive updates on Badmintons Best and about the Badminton world in general!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy smashing!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Which Badminton Racquet is Best for Me?]]></title><description><![CDATA[I‚Äôve played with the same badminton racquets for over 12 years, it wasn‚Äôt until I broke one of only two racquets I had (a Yonex Armortec 90‚Ä¶]]></description><link>https://www.badmintonsbest.com/blog/which-badminton-racquet-is-best-for-me/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.badmintonsbest.com/blog/which-badminton-racquet-is-best-for-me/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jul 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve played with the same badminton racquets for over 12 years, it wasn‚Äôt until I broke one of only two racquets I had (a Yonex Armortec 900 Power) that I realised I might need to get some more but after 12 years with the same racquets how was I going to be able to pick a new one right for me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best way to find the racquet which is best for you is based on a number of factors including; physical strength and attributes, playing ability, play style and price and feel. Looking at these six things in combination let‚Äôs see how we can pick the best racquet for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Physical Strength and Attributes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest reason why physical strength matters in racquet selection has nothing to do with how ‚Äúhard‚Äù you can hit the shuttle but has more to do with your force on the racquet. Racquets have something called flex or stiffness depending on which brand you buy, for our purposes we will refer to this as flex. Different brands have different scales for flex but most have four to five levels of flex for their racquets ranging from very flexible to extra stiff. The flex is in relation to how bendy the shaft of the racquet is, the shaft is highlighted below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of designing racquets this way works like this; the more flexible the racquet the easier it is to get the racquet to bend when you play a shot. The bend in the racquet allows the racquet to recoil and generate more power, it acts sort of like a whip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So flexible racquets make it easier to get the power for players who are either beginner level or simply lack the physical power to get the bend in a stiffer racquet, however this does have a downside. The racquet has a natural limit for players who are much stronger and those players will find after a certain point the racquet won‚Äôt give them more power no matter how much effort they exert which is why there are stiffer racquets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stiff and extra stiff racquets are more suited to advanced and physically stronger players who have the technique and the power to get the stiffer racquets to bend. A stiffer racquet will recoil with greater force because it takes a greater force to bend it. Imagine a tree sapling and a old oak tree on a windy day, the sapling will bend easily in the wind without much effort but the oak tree won‚Äôt budge at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trait about racquets not often talked about is the racquets weight and grip size. These both relate to a players physical attributes rather than his strength. Players with greater racquet control tend to go for racquets with smaller grip sizes for more refined touch and feel but this can be difficult for beginners or if you have big hands so might be better suited to a racquet with a slightly bigger grip size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same racquet can also come in different weights and based on the player it might be better to have a lighter version say if you don‚Äôt have a particularly strong wrist or if you play more doubles and need shorter sharper shots which will be easier with a lighter racquet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playing Ability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your level of playing ability relates to your experience and playing level in badminton. If you‚Äôre a beginner you‚Äôll be more suited to pick an all round racquet that is easy to play with to build on basic skills and fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your an intermediate that has a moderate amount of experience and plays at a decent level you‚Äôll more likely need something above the all round level of racquets that presents a bit more of a challenge to master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your an advanced player you‚Äôre more likely to know how you play, your level of play and need something that provides a real challenge to play with but once mastered provides you better control, more responsiveness and accuracy in your shots and generate more power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Play Style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you play also matters a great deal, there are two more racquet attributes to take into consideration which are the balance and weight of the actual racquet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is meant by balance?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balance, or often referred to as head balance, relates to how the racquet weight is distributed throughout and how the racquet. There are three different types which are head heavy, head light and balanced. If you take a balanced racquet and balance it using just one finger you‚Äôll find that the balancing point is in the middle. If you take a head heavy racquet you‚Äôll find the balancing point nearer the head of the racquet and for head-light closer to the handle. This is by design and each type provides a different feel and has pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head-heavy racquets are favoured for these pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the majority of the weight in the head of the racquet the head follows through with the swing with more momentum which generates more speed and therefore power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs easier to feel the end point of the racquet due to the weight and therefore develops more control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head-heavy racquets have natural cons though including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the extra weight in the head of the racquet it becomes harder to play defensively as defensive shots require shorter, sharper, faster movements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can be quite draining as you need to control the racquet more after strokes to stop yourself from dropping the racquet too low after each shot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of head-heavy racquets like a big sledge hammer, they provide a lot of oomph but also require a lot of strength and dexterity to control due to their imbalance. Singles players often love playing with these types of racquets because they have more time between shots unlike doubles play which means better net control and a more powerful smash outweigh the cons related to fatigue and defensive sharpness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head-light racquets are favoured for these pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They feel light in hand even though they may be the same weight as another racquet which makes them less tiring to play with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs easier to play shorted sharper shots without losing control of the positioning of the racquet head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They‚Äôre opposing cons are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People can try too hard to generate more power in smashing the shuttle with these racquets as the momentum of the racquet doesn‚Äôt naturally follow through which could result in shoulder or elbow injuries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controlling the head of the racquet is considerably easier but it is harder to feel the end point of the racquet and how much it is dipped for a tight spinning next shot for example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head-light racquets are much more suited to doubles players who need fast reactions and even faster racquet skills. They‚Äôre much like a fencing sword, easy to flick and whip shots but no as adapt at delivering heavy blows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balanced racquets provide a good experience between head-heavy and head-light racquets, the are good all rounders without having any major standout advantages or disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to be overlooked but the price of the racquet matters as well. The price matters less if you know the racquet is the best one for you but having said that I always have at least two of the same racquet in case one breaks or a string goes then I can switch racquets without disruption to my game. So being able to buy more than one can matter and if it‚Äôs very expensive your wallet will be weeping if you ever need to buy another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least is feel something else not often discussed but how a racquet feels when you play with it is like first impressions. When you meet someone for the first time you tend to get a feel for the person very quickly, you quickly understand whether you like them or not and whether you will get along with this person. This can likely change over time but how you feel about and around that person is unlikely to change a great deal. It‚Äôs the same for racquets, when trying a racquet for the first time you can get a feel very quickly whether you‚Äôre suited for it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel good playing with the racquet sometimes that‚Äôs all that matters. If you don‚Äôt feel good playing with a racquet or if it feels difficult and alien then it‚Äôs probably not the right racquet for you. Practicing more with a racquet can change that but that will take time and adjustment to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, it all comes down to you as an individual, you can look at this racquet and that and measure the differences but if you look at the best players in the world they don‚Äôt all use the same racquet because there is simply isn‚Äôt one racquet that is best for everyone. Everyone is different, everyone is unique and you should try a few racquets that have different head balance, flex, weight, grip size and prices to find the racquet which is best for you.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>

Everything including racquets, shuttlecocks, shoes, clothing, bags, grips, strings. You name it and I’ve probably tried it. My preferences in equipment have changed as I’ve grown up with the sport so I know what suits beginners and what suits more advanced players.</p>\n<p>I’ve also bought from multiple brands so I know how the same product from two different brands can be different. As I’ve progressed and advanced in the sport I’ve even collated a list of books and resources I believe anyone looking for self-improvement and improvement in Badminton should read.</p>\n<p>Please note, these recommendations are from my own personal experience. I’ve tried or owned all the items on these lists so the recommendations are genuine. Some of these recommendations are budget-friendly and some are indulgences but they’re what I believe provides the best value for money.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/BadmintonsBest/recommended-gear/best-badminton-racquets\">Best Badminton Racquets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/BadmintonsBest/recommended-gear/best-shuttlecocks\">Best Badminton Shuttlecocks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/BadmintonsBest/recommended-gear/best-badminton-accessories\">Best Badminton Accessories</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/BadmintonsBest/recommended-gear/best-badminton-bags\">Best Badminton Bags</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/BadmintonsBest/recommended-gear/best-badminton-shoes\">Best Badminton Shoes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/BadmintonsBest/recommended-gear/best-badminton-books\">Best Books for Badminton</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Best Badminton Gear - Tried and Tested Recommendations","description":"Over the years of playing Badminton, I’ve bought, used and tried a lot of different Badminton gear.

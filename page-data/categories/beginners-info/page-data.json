A good short serve can give you an advantage from the start of the rally. Here we'll be talking mainly about the backhand serve in relation to doubles.

I don't think I've ever met someone who is coordinated with both hands. Things like writing and drawing etc people only do it with one hand. Their left or right. Be some gifted people can do them with both hands. So what if those people played a sport like Badminton, Tennis or Squash? Could they play with either hand? Another question would then be. Can Badminton be played with both hands?","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/can-you-serve-overhand-in-badminton/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Can You Serve Overhand in Badminton?","description":"It's the default in Tennis and you can even see it done in squash and table tennis. Serving overhand in other racquet sports is normally legal. A good serve can be all the difference in racquet sports. Most people picking up a racquet for the first time will naturally look to serve underarm in Badminton. It feels natural, the shuttlecock has to go over the net so it makes sense to serve underarm. But it begs to question, can you serve overhand in Badminton?","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/badminton-vs-tennis-courts/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Are Badminton and Tennis Courts the Same?","description":"Some sports can share venues, you see it all the time. Football stadiums can host rugby matches and netball matches can be played at basketball venues. These are just two examples of how sports venues can be multi-use. People know there are differences between all of these sports and that just because they can be played at the same venue doesn't mean the court or field setup is the same. They're not the same. So the question is; are Badminton and Tennis courts the same?","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/improve-your-reaction-time-badminton/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Improve Your Reaction Time in Badminton","description":"You see it all the time on the world stage for badminton. Elite level players are capable of defending smashes of over 350kmph. They're capable of picking up deceptive shots when wrong-footed. They're capable of incredible feats of speed and agility! The best elite players are able to keep up with the pace of the game thanks to stupidly fast reaction times.

The Secret to Speed in Badminton","description":"Everyone I’ve ever met in badminton always asks the question; “how can I get faster” or “how can I go faster to the shuttle” and I really believe that one of the keys to great speed in badminton is practising footwork. A lot of coaches go over the various movements that get you to the shuttle in a certain way, either by travelling backwards, forwards or sideways, slow and fast movements etc. One of the key technique which isn’t given enough focus is the split step. So what is it and how can it help to learn this technique?","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/how-to-warm-up-and-cooldown/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Warm-Up and Cooldown Properly to Avoid Injury?","description":"I was out playing badminton the other night at the badminton league club I play for just for a general practice, I have been playing as much recently so was feeling a bit rusty going on to have a knock up to warm-up. I thought about that and actually, I've always been taught to do a full dynamic warm-up properly before getting onto court and to do a cooldown afterwards. All the coaches I've ever been too always instructed and insisted on that for the simple fact that it's necessary to decrease the risk of picking up an injury. So how do you warm-up properly and cooldown properly?","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/how-to-hold-a-badminton-racquet/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Hold a Badminton Racquet - The Correct Badminton Grip","description":"I’ve been playing for a long time but every now and then I practice something and when it’s not working consistently I come back to the basics and see if there is anything I’m doing wrong there that might be hindering me practicing or playing a certain shot. One of the basics which is often overlooked is how you hold the racquet or your “grip”. I had a habit of letting the handle of the racquet turn too much in my grip, I was holding it too loose, and as a result, I wasn’t getting power or accuracy in some shots because when I hit the shuttle it was never with a consistent grip.","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/which-badminton-racquet-is-best-for-me/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Which Badminton Racquet is Best for Me?","description":"I’ve played with the same badminton racquets for over 12 years, it wasn’t until I broke one of only two racquets I had (a Yonex Armortec 900 Power) that I realised I might need to get some more but after 12 years with the same racquets how was I going to be able to pick a new one right for me?","featured":null}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"category":"Beginners Info"}}}

The Secret to Speed in Badminton","date":"2018-12-04","description":"Everyone I’ve ever met in badminton always asks the question; “how can I get faster” or “how can I go faster to the shuttle” and I really believe that one of the keys to great speed in badminton is practising footwork. A lot of coaches go over the various movements that get you to the shuttle in a certain way, either by travelling backwards, forwards or sideways, slow and fast movements etc. One of the key technique which isn’t given enough focus is the split step. So what is it and how can it help to learn this technique?","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/how-to-warm-up-and-cooldown/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Warm-Up and Cooldown Properly to Avoid Injury?","date":"2018-09-16","description":"I was out playing badminton the other night at the badminton league club I play for just for a general practice, I have been playing as much recently so was feeling a bit rusty going on to have a knock up to warm-up. I thought about that and actually, I've always been taught to do a full dynamic warm-up properly before getting onto court and to do a cooldown afterwards. All the coaches I've ever been too always instructed and insisted on that for the simple fact that it's necessary to decrease the risk of picking up an injury. So how do you warm-up properly and cooldown properly?","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/can-i-play-badminton-whilst-pregnant/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Can I Play Badminton Whilst Pregnant?","date":"2018-09-09","description":"Fun fact, I once had the honour of training and playing with the Olympic silver medalists Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson, true story. At the time Gail Emms was expecting her first child which would turn out to be a boy and despite being heavily pregnant at the time was still able and willing to do the group training session I was attending alongside Nathan. Despite being very heavily pregnant she managed to do the training session helping other and managed a shortened mixed game at the end playing against Nathan and each of them playing with someone from the session. Obviously being an Olympian level athlete and previous world champion to boot, a short match for fun should be no problem, right? You can still play Badminton while pregnant, right?","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/how-to-hit-a-killer-badminton-smash/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Hit a Killer Badminton Smash!

It’s definitely the most exciting shot to play and watch in the sport, there really isn’t anything else quite like it.

One of the things I’ve learnt more about is about strings for badminton racquets. It’s not often talked about as most people never end up changing the strings they use for their racquets because they take their stringers recommendation, which is definitely not a bad thing. I, however, wanted to learn more about the types of strings and which ones were best for me.","featured":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5086206896551724,"src":"/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/fd334/featured.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/5f26b/featured.jpg 175w,\n/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/e8857/featured.jpg 350w,\n/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/fd334/featured.jpg 700w,\n/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/32983/featured.jpg 1050w,\n/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/bf790/featured.jpg 1400w,\n/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/8cd56/featured.jpg 2838w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/how-to-hold-a-badminton-racquet/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Hold a Badminton Racquet - The Correct Badminton Grip","date":"2018-07-16","description":"I’ve been playing for a long time but every now and then I practice something and when it’s not working consistently I come back to the basics and see if there is anything I’m doing wrong there that might be hindering me practicing or playing a certain shot. One of the basics which is often overlooked is how you hold the racquet or your “grip”. I had a habit of letting the handle of the racquet turn too much in my grip, I was holding it too loose, and as a result, I wasn’t getting power or accuracy in some shots because when I hit the shuttle it was never with a consistent grip.","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/five-reasons-badminton-will-help-you-lose-weight/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"5 Reasons Badminton Will Help You Lose Weight","date":"2018-07-10","description":"Everybody wants to be trim, everybody wants to stay in shape but not everybody enjoys going to the gym, I believe the best answer is finding a sport you love is the best way to get in shape as you’ll enjoy getting a sweat on more and it won’t feel like such a chore.","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/which-badminton-racquet-is-best-for-me/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Which Badminton Racquet is Best for Me?","date":"2018-07-07","description":"I’ve played with the same badminton racquets for over 12 years, it wasn’t until I broke one of only two racquets I had (a Yonex Armortec 900 Power) that I realised I might need to get some more but after 12 years with the same racquets how was I going to be able to pick a new one right for me?","featured":null}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"category":"Common Questions"}}}

One of the things I’ve learnt more about is about strings for badminton racquets. It’s not often talked about as most people never end up changing the strings they use for their racquets because they take their stringers recommendation, which is definitely not a bad thing. I, however, wanted to learn more about the types of strings and which ones were best for me.","featured":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.6,"src":"/BadmintonsBest/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/c85ac/featured.jpg","srcSet":"/BadmintonsBest/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/64ade/featured.jpg 200w,\n/BadmintonsBest/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/32db7/featured.jpg 400w,\n/BadmintonsBest/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/c85ac/featured.jpg 800w,\n/BadmintonsBest/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/2024d/featured.jpg 1200w,\n/BadmintonsBest/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/57587/featured.jpg 1600w,\n/BadmintonsBest/static/d6d87cfea068c39ac27fd4f775155e02/4d351/featured.jpg 2838w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/how-to-hold-a-badminton-racquet/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"July 16, 2018","title":"How to Hold a Badminton Racquet - The Correct Badminton Grip","description":"I’ve been playing for a long time but every now and then I practice something and when it’s not working consistently I come back to the basics and see if there is anything I’m doing wrong there that might be hindering me practicing or playing a certain shot. One of the basics which is often overlooked is how you hold the racquet or your “grip”. I had a habit of letting the handle of the racquet turn too much in my grip, I was holding it too loose, and as a result, I wasn’t getting power or accuracy in some shots because when I hit the shuttle it was never with a consistent grip.","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/five-reasons-badminton-will-help-you-lose-weight/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"July 10, 2018","title":"5 Reasons Badminton Will Help You Lose Weight","description":"Everybody wants to be trim, everybody wants to stay in shape but not everybody enjoys going to the gym, I believe the best answer is finding a sport you love is the best way to get in shape as you’ll enjoy getting a sweat on more and it won’t feel like such a chore.","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/which-badminton-racquet-is-best-for-me/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"July 07, 2018","title":"Which Badminton Racquet is Best for Me?","description":"I’ve played with the same badminton racquets for over 12 years, it wasn’t until I broke one of only two racquets I had (a Yonex Armortec 900 Power) that I realised I might need to get some more but after 12 years with the same racquets how was I going to be able to pick a new one right for me?","featured":null}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"limit":6,"skip":18,"numPages":4,"currentPage":4,"type":"blog"}}}

Football stadiums can host rugby matches and netball matches can be played at basketball venues. These are just two examples of how sports venues can be multi-use. People know there are differences between all of these sports and that just because they can be played at the same venue doesn't mean the court or field setup is the same. They're not the same. So the question is; are Badminton and Tennis courts the same?","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/are-badminton-and-volleyball-nets-the-same/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"February 22, 2019","title":"Are Badminton and Volleyball Nets the Same?","description":"The Badminton club which I play for uses a school's sports hall as a venue. I turned up for practice one night and saw something I've never seen since. Someone had turned up early and set up the nets ready for people to play when they got there. But this person used Volleyball nets mistakenly with the Badminton posts instead of the actual Badminton nets. The results were strange, to say the least. So are Badminton and Volleyball nets the same?","featured":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMBBAX/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABzSvKNFEf/8QAGRABAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECERIi/9oACAEBAAEFAomsPDKscsf/xAAXEQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARES/9oACAEDAQE/Acwp/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAgEBPwE//8QAGRAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADIBIKGS/9oACAEBAAY/AnjkfB8p/8QAGxAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEBcUGRsfD/2gAIAQEAAT8hjuh8uPw2LlyEP//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQk/8A/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBH/2gAIAQMBAT8QoP/EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAR/9oACAECAQE/EKf/xAAaEAADAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhMVGR/9oACAEBAAE/EERYSaMd8IGxqRJXNEdvCCU//9k=","aspectRatio":1.5086206896551724,"src":"/static/ead5e9b576f2cb90f2fe12a8d142561a/ac0ae/featured.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ead5e9b576f2cb90f2fe12a8d142561a/dcd85/featured.jpg 175w,\n/static/ead5e9b576f2cb90f2fe12a8d142561a/be085/featured.jpg 350w,\n/static/ead5e9b576f2cb90f2fe12a8d142561a/ac0ae/featured.jpg 700w,\n/static/ead5e9b576f2cb90f2fe12a8d142561a/ddaee/featured.jpg 1050w,\n/static/ead5e9b576f2cb90f2fe12a8d142561a/cb76e/featured.jpg 1400w,\n/static/ead5e9b576f2cb90f2fe12a8d142561a/1572e/featured.jpg 3872w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/improve-your-reaction-time-badminton/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"February 19, 2019","title":"How to Improve Your Reaction Time in Badminton","description":"You see it all the time on the world stage for badminton. Elite level players are capable of defending smashes of over 350kmph. They're capable of picking up deceptive shots when wrong-footed. They're capable of incredible feats of speed and agility! The best elite players are able to keep up with the pace of the game thanks to stupidly fast reaction times. So how do you improve your reaction time in Badminton?","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/the-split-step/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"December 04, 2018","title":"What is a Split Step? The Secret to Speed in Badminton","description":"Everyone I’ve ever met in badminton always asks the question; “how can I get faster” or “how can I go faster to the shuttle” and I really believe that one of the keys to great speed in badminton is practising footwork. A lot of coaches go over the various movements that get you to the shuttle in a certain way, either by travelling backwards, forwards or sideways, slow and fast movements etc. One of the key technique which isn’t given enough focus is the split step. So what is it and how can it help to learn this technique?","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/how-to-warm-up-and-cooldown/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"September 16, 2018","title":"How to Warm-Up and Cooldown Properly to Avoid Injury?","description":"I was out playing badminton the other night at the badminton league club I play for just for a general practice, I have been playing as much recently so was feeling a bit rusty going on to have a knock up to warm-up. I thought about that and actually, I've always been taught to do a full dynamic warm-up properly before getting onto court and to do a cooldown afterwards. All the coaches I've ever been too always instructed and insisted on that for the simple fact that it's necessary to decrease the risk of picking up an injury. So how do you warm-up properly and cooldown properly?","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/can-i-play-badminton-whilst-pregnant/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"September 09, 2018","title":"Can I Play Badminton Whilst Pregnant?","description":"Fun fact, I once had the honour of training and playing with the Olympic silver medalists Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson, true story. At the time Gail Emms was expecting her first child which would turn out to be a boy and despite being heavily pregnant at the time was still able and willing to do the group training session I was attending alongside Nathan. Despite being very heavily pregnant she managed to do the training session helping other and managed a shortened mixed game at the end playing against Nathan and each of them playing with someone from the session. Obviously being an Olympian level athlete and previous world champion to boot, a short match for fun should be no problem, right? You can still play Badminton while pregnant, right?","featured":null}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"limit":6,"skip":36,"numPages":8,"currentPage":7,"type":"blog"}}}

I used to play with a kids set that had plastic shuttles, simple racquets and a popup net. I used to with my brother and sister in the summertime. Looking back now it's not really the Badminton we know and love is it? But it does bring up an interesting question.

Football stadiums can host rugby matches and netball matches can be played at basketball venues. These are just two examples of how sports venues can be multi-use. People know there are differences between all of these sports and that just because they can be played at the same venue doesn't mean the court or field setup is the same. They're not the same.

I turned up for practice one night and saw something I've never seen since. Someone had turned up early and set up the nets ready for people to play when they got there. But this person used Volleyball nets mistakenly with the Badminton posts instead of the actual Badminton nets. The results were strange, to say the least.

The Secret to Speed in Badminton","description":"Everyone I’ve ever met in badminton always asks the question; “how can I get faster” or “how can I go faster to the shuttle” and I really believe that one of the keys to great speed in badminton is practising footwork. A lot of coaches go over the various movements that get you to the shuttle in a certain way, either by travelling backwards, forwards or sideways, slow and fast movements etc. One of the key technique which isn’t given enough focus is the split step. So what is it and how can it help to learn this technique?","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/how-to-warm-up-and-cooldown/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"September 16, 2018","title":"How to Warm-Up and Cooldown Properly to Avoid Injury?","description":"I was out playing badminton the other night at the badminton league club I play for just for a general practice, I have been playing as much recently so was feeling a bit rusty going on to have a knock up to warm-up. I thought about that and actually, I've always been taught to do a full dynamic warm-up properly before getting onto court and to do a cooldown afterwards. All the coaches I've ever been too always instructed and insisted on that for the simple fact that it's necessary to decrease the risk of picking up an injury. So how do you warm-up properly and cooldown properly?","featured":null}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"limit":6,"skip":36,"numPages":8,"currentPage":7,"type":"blog"}}}

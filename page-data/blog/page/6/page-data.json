In basketball and volleyball you see a lot of the best players are tall, commonly at least six feet tall. In other sports, it's more desirable to be shorter and more compact like racing jockeys. So naturally, there must be traits that are desirable for Badminton?

Serving overhand in other racquet sports is normally legal. A good serve can be all the difference in racquet sports. Most people picking up a racquet for the first time will naturally look to serve underarm in Badminton. It feels natural, the shuttlecock has to go over the net so it makes sense to serve underarm. But it begs to question, can you serve overhand in Badminton?","featured":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/can-badminton-be-played-outdoors/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"March 06, 2019","title":"Can Badminton be Played Outdoors?","description":"I used to play Badminton outside, at least what I thought was Badminton.

I don't think I've ever met someone who is coordinated with both hands. Things like writing and drawing etc people only do it with one hand. Their left or right. Be some gifted people can do them with both hands. So what if those people played a sport like Badminton, Tennis or Squash? Could they play with either hand? Another question would then be.

Serving overhand in other racquet sports is normally legal. A good serve can be all the difference in racquet sports.

I don't think I've ever met someone who is coordinated with both hands. Things like writing and drawing etc people only do it with one hand. Their left or right. Be some gifted people can do them with both hands. So what if those people played a sport like Badminton, Tennis or Squash? Could they play with either hand? Another question would then be. Can Badminton be played with both hands?"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/is-a-badminton-racquet-allowed-in-flight/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"March 18, 2019","title":"Is a Badminton Racquet Allowed in Flight? [All Major Airlines]","description":"I've never taken my Badminton equipment on holiday. I've never travelled with my Badminton equipment by any others mean other than driving. International players have to take their equipment wherever they go. I can imagine being a little nervous ever letting your bag out of sight. Our equipment becomes very personal and we like to have it close at all times. So, can a Badminton racquet be taken on a flight as hand luggage?"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/do-you-have-to-be-tall-to-play-badminton/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"March 16, 2019","title":"Do You Have to be Tall to Play Badminton?","description":"Throughout sport, you always see shared trends in athletes who are at the top of the sport. In basketball and volleyball you see a lot of the best players are tall, commonly at least six feet tall. In other sports, it's more desirable to be shorter and more compact like racing jockeys. So naturally, there must be traits that are desirable for Badminton? So do you have to be tall to play Badminton?"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/can-you-serve-overhand-in-badminton/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"March 07, 2019","title":"Can You Serve Overhand in Badminton?","description":"It's the default in Tennis and you can even see it done in squash and table tennis. Serving overhand in other racquet sports is normally legal. A good serve can be all the difference in racquet sports. Most people picking up a racquet for the first time will naturally look to serve underarm in Badminton. It feels natural, the shuttlecock has to go over the net so it makes sense to serve underarm. But it begs to question, can you serve overhand in Badminton?"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/can-badminton-be-played-outdoors/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"March 06, 2019","title":"Can Badminton be Played Outdoors?","description":"I used to play Badminton outside, at least what I thought was Badminton. I used to play with a kids set that had plastic shuttles, simple racquets and a popup net. I used to with my brother and sister in the summertime. Looking back now it's not really the Badminton we know and love is it? But it does bring up an interesting question. Can Badminton be played outdoors?"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/badminton-vs-tennis-courts/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"February 27, 2019","title":"Are Badminton and Tennis Courts the Same?","description":"Some sports can share venues, you see it all the time. Football stadiums can host rugby matches and netball matches can be played at basketball venues. These are just two examples of how sports venues can be multi-use. People know there are differences between all of these sports and that just because they can be played at the same venue doesn't mean the court or field setup is the same. They're not the same. So the question is; are Badminton and Tennis courts the same?"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"limit":6,"skip":6,"numPages":4,"currentPage":2,"type":"blog"}}}

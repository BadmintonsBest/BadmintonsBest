The grip patterns on Tennis and Badminton shoes are very different. Because Badminton has you moving in all directions the grip patterns are designed to be radial. They grip strongly in whichever direction friction is applied. Tennis shoes have a variety of grip patterns. Clay court shoes usually have herringbone tread pattern (a zig-zag like pattern) that stops clay getting lodged. It also allows for controlled sliding whilst still giving grip. Grass court shoes have a pimply pattern and are only suitable for grass courts. They provide a lot of grip because grass is the most slippery court surface for Tennis.

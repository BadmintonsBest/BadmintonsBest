If you just wanted to hit the fastest smash you could do that whilst standing but you\\u2019ll most likely hit a very flat smash and the opponent would only need to be able to react to the right direction to return the smash.

In singles, it is more common to smash down the line (the inner sideline used to mark the boundary for singles) and to cross smash (smashing the shuttle cross court from your position). The reason for placing the smashes like this in singles is because your opponent is only one person it\\u2019s more difficult to cover the width of the court and hence there is more space to attack them down the lines. It is not often seen but the other smash variation is a body smash, often referred to as \\u201Csmashing into the body\\u201D where you aim directly at the opponent often targeting their racquet arm hip or shoulder. There are times when smashing at the opponent in singles is beneficial, either when the player is constantly expecting the smashes to go down the line and your smashes need some variation to keep them guessing or against tall players smashing at the body can be quite effective as it\\u2019s harder to move longer arms and legs in a smaller confined space.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"When playing doubles it\\u2019s more common to either smash down the middle (in between the two defending players) or body smashing more. Hitting the smash down the middle takes the angles of reply away from the defenders, the reason doubles players try and do this is to try and give their partner who should be at the front of the court the best opportunity to intercept or kill the next shot, let me explain further. If you smash down the line in doubles with two players on the other side standing side by side you don\\u2019t get much advantage from aiming down the line because all they need to do is reach with their racquet out and they can get it and good players will be able to drive the shuttle back bypassing your partner at the front of the court. If you smash in between the two players not only can you create confusion between the two, as they might think the other one should retrieve it, but the shuttle will have to travel from the middle of their side which cuts out the opportunity to cross the shuttle or play it back down the line. In doubles, the aim should always be to set up the front player to finish the rally. It is much easier to kill the rally from the net from a weak reply then to try and completely smash through a pair waiting for exactly that, a smash!\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Smashing at the body is also useful in doubles for the same reason, when you smash directly at the opponent you should be aiming for the racquet hip (the hip of the side of which they hold their racquet, right-handed player hit the right hip etc), the racquet shoulder and down by the feet. Aiming for the hip and shoulder is effective because it forces the player to sway their body to one side in order to be able to defend the shot, pick up and racquet and try playing an imaginary defensive shot aimed at your hip or shoulder and notice how you can\\u2019t angle the racquet without moving yourself first. If the opponent doesn\\u2019t react quick enough they simply won\\u2019t be able to play a shot back and if they do react they\\u2019re more likely to make a mistake. Smashing down near the feet makes it harder to reach the shuttle, the other pair is covering the width of the court but if your smash is steep they\\u2019ll struggle to even reach it before it hits the floor. If they manage to get it back the shuttle has to go up giving either the front player a chance to intercept of you a chance to attack again.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Personally I think smash power should be the last thing to think about when trying to improve the smash because if you could smash at 400kph like the professionals but couldn\\u2019t control the placement or the angle then good players will simply feed off of that power and use it against you, having said that it is important.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"A lot of people think hitting the smash as hard as you can everytime is what you should aim for and that\\u2019s simply not true. Watch Lin Dan play at any point in his career and you can definitely tell that he doesn\\u2019t always hit his smashes as hard as he can 100% of the time he more than not waits for the easy opportunity to go full pace with the smash because he is most likely to win the rally at that point and can afford to commit to following it up and in doubles you can see the likes of Lee Yong Dae and Hendra Setiawan don\\u2019t often play as rear court players in doubles but when they do they\\u2019re calculated in picking and choosing when to smash with full power.

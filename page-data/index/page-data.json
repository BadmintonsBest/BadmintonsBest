I turned up for practice one night and saw something I've never seen since. Someone had turned up early and set up the nets ready for people to play when they got there. But this person used Volleyball nets mistakenly with the Badminton posts instead of the actual Badminton nets. The results were strange, to say the least. So are Badminton and Volleyball nets the same?","featured":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5086206896551724,"src":"/static/ead5e9b576f2cb90f2fe12a8d142561a/ac0ae/featured.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ead5e9b576f2cb90f2fe12a8d142561a/dcd85/featured.jpg 175w,\n/static/ead5e9b576f2cb90f2fe12a8d142561a/be085/featured.jpg 350w,\n/static/ead5e9b576f2cb90f2fe12a8d142561a/ac0ae/featured.jpg 700w,\n/static/ead5e9b576f2cb90f2fe12a8d142561a/ddaee/featured.jpg 1050w,\n/static/ead5e9b576f2cb90f2fe12a8d142561a/cb76e/featured.jpg 1400w,\n/static/ead5e9b576f2cb90f2fe12a8d142561a/1572e/featured.jpg 3872w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"You see it all the time on the world stage for badminton.

All the coaches I've ever been too always instructed and insisted on that for the simple fact that it's necessary to decrease the risk of picking up an injury.

At the time Gail Emms was expecting her first child which would turn out to be a boy and despite being heavily pregnant at the time was still able and willing to do the group training session I was attending alongside Nathan. Despite being very heavily pregnant she managed to do the training session helping other and managed a shortened mixed game at the end playing against Nathan and each of them playing with someone from the session. Obviously being an Olympian level athlete and previous world champion to boot, a short match for fun should be no problem, right?

I used to play with a kids set that had plastic shuttles, simple racquets and a popup net. I used to with my brother and sister in the summertime. Looking back now it's not really the Badminton we know and love is it? But it does bring up an interesting question. Can Badminton be played outdoors?","featured":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5086206896551724,"src":"/static/c7fafce4a18e15a31e191ae465f1cb8c/fd334/featured.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c7fafce4a18e15a31e191ae465f1cb8c/5f26b/featured.jpg 175w,\n/static/c7fafce4a18e15a31e191ae465f1cb8c/e8857/featured.jpg 350w,\n/static/c7fafce4a18e15a31e191ae465f1cb8c/fd334/featured.jpg 700w,\n/static/c7fafce4a18e15a31e191ae465f1cb8c/32983/featured.jpg 1050w,\n/static/c7fafce4a18e15a31e191ae465f1cb8c/bf790/featured.jpg 1400w,\n/static/c7fafce4a18e15a31e191ae465f1cb8c/91b7c/featured.jpg 3840w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Some sports can share venues, you see it all the time.

Despite being very heavily pregnant she managed to do the training session helping other and managed a shortened mixed game at the end playing against Nathan and each of them playing with someone from the session.
